Polls before the vote predicted that the yes camp would win with a comfortable 66% share. Santos had been confident of a yes result and said during the campaign that he did not have a plan B and that. Colombia. Both government and rebels have repeatedly said that the deal was the best they could achieve and a renegotiation would not be possible.. . Colombia referendum. Santos, who watched the results come in at the presidential palace in Bogot , said he would send his negotiators back to Havana to meet with Farc leaders on Monday.  I will not give up,  he said in a televised address.  I will continue seeking peace until the last day of my presidency. . He added that the bilateral ceasefire that has been in place since 29 August would continue.. Santos, who has staked his legacy on achieving peace, said he would meet with all political parties on Monday to find a way forward for the peace process.

To the Colombian people who dream of peace, count on us, peace will triumph. . Fernando Giraldo, a political analyst, said the fact that both the government and guerrillas reiterated their commitment to peace was a good sign but the future was unclear.  The plebiscite laid everything out in black and white and now we re stuck in a grey area,  he said.. Under the agreement rejected by voters, the Farc s 5,800 fighters and a similar number of urban militia members would have disarmed and become a legal political party. Whether or when that will happen now is unknown.. The deal would have allowed rebel leaders to avoid jail if they confessed to their crimes such as killings, kidnappings, indiscriminate attacks and child recruitment, something that many Colombians found hard to swallow.. By promoting a no vote, Uribe argued that he did not support continued war but wanted to fix the agreement.  Colombians, let s correct the path,  he said after the final results of the vote were announced.  We insist on correctives so that the constitution is respected, not substitutes, [that there be] justice, and not the derogation of institutions, political pluralism without it appearing to be a prize for criminals,  he said..

But the apologies and promises appear to have come too late to sway voters.

Yoshinori Ohsumi, 71, will receive the prestigious 8m Swedish kronor ( 718,000) award for uncovering  mechanisms for autophagy , a fundamental process in cells that scientists believe can be harnessed to fight cancer and dementia.. Autophagy is the body s internal recycling programme - scrap cell components are captured and the useful parts are stripped out to generate energy or build new cells. The process is crucial for preventing cancerous growths, warding off infection and, by maintaining a healthy metabolism, it helps protect against conditions like diabetes.. . . . .

Intense research is underway to develop drugs that can target autophagy to treat various diseases.. Speaking to reporters in Tokyo on Monday, Ohsumi said:  As a boy, the Nobel Prize was a dream, but after starting my research, it was out of my picture. . He said he chose to focus on the cell s waste disposal system, an unfashionable subject at the time, because he wanted to work on something different..  I don t feel comfortable competing with many people, and instead I find it more enjoyable doing something nobody else is doing,  he added.  In a way, that s what science is all about, and the joy of finding something inspires me. . Ohsumi, who was in his lab when he received the phone call from Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel Committee, admitted to being in a  slight state of shock  about the news.. The word autophagy originates from two Greek words meaning  self-eating . It refers to the process in which cellular junk is captured and sealed in sack-like membranes, called autophagosomes. The sealed contents are transported to another structure called the lysosome, once considered little more than the cellular rubbish bin.. By studying the process in yeast cells, Ohsumi identified the main genes involved in autophagy and showed how the proteins they code for come together to build the autophagosome membrane. He later showed that a similar cellular recycling process occurs in human cells - and that our cells would not survive without it.. Juleen Zierath, a member of the Nobel committee, said:  Every day we need to replace about 200 to 300g of protein in our bodies... We are eating proteins every day, about 70g, but that s not enough to take care of the requirement to make new proteins. Because of this machinery, we re able to rely on some of our own proteins, maybe the damaged proteins or the long-lived proteins, and they are recycled with this sophisticated machinery so that we can sustain and we survive. . Professor David Rubinsztein, deputy director of the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research at the University of Cambridge, said that Ohsumi s discoveries had provided deep insights into the biology underpinning infectious diseases, cancers, Huntington s and Parkinson s..  I m very happy he s got this year s Nobel prize, it s very well deserved,  he said.  His lab mainly works in yeast. They did the initial screens that enabled the discovery of key genes that are involved in autophagy. So many other labs have exploited his discoveries, directly or indirectly, to see why it s important in diseases. . Giovanna Mallucci, a professor of clinical neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, said that Ohsumi s discoveries were paving the way for new approaches to treating diseases, from cancer to neurodegenerative illnesses..  I think it s very important that this area of science been recognised,  she said.  The important principle here is going for common mechanisms in disease. It opens up avenues to treating these disorders that are different from more conventional disease-specific approaches. . Last year, the prize was. shared by three scientists. The Chinese chemist,. Tu Youyou. The winners of the physics, chemistry and peace prizes are to be announced later this week. The economics prize will be announced on Monday 10 October.. . . More news. Topics. . .

The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb n, has failed to convince a majority of his population to vote in a referendum on closing the door to refugees, rendering the result invalid and undermining his campaign for a cultural counter-revolution within the. European Union. More than 98% of participants in Sunday s referendum sided with Orb n by voting against the admission of refugees to. Hungary. Orb n himself put a positive spin on the low turnout. He argued that while  a valid [referendum] is always better than an invalid [referendum]  the extremely high proportion of no-voters still gave him a mandate to go to Brussels next week  to ensure that we should not be forced to accept in Hungary people we don t want to live with .. . . . . How do you feel about Hungary's refugee referendum?. . . . .

The result, though, gives potential respite to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and EU officials in Brussels, whose comparatively progressive refugee policies and liberal political outlook had been under sustained assault from Orb n in recent months.. Internationally, Orb n s referendum was seen as a plebiscite on not just the EU s refugee-sharing quota   which would see just 1,294 refugees resettled in Hungary from Greece and Italy   but on the role of nation state and the future of liberal democracy within the EU.. Presenting himself as the voice of the European masses, Orb n had called for a cultural rebellion within the EU, praised aspects of illiberal strongman leadership that are anathema to the EU s professed values and opposed attempts to share responsibility for refugees between EU states.. The refugee referendum was an attempt to build support for this vision and Orb n hoped that a strong turnout would lead to a series of copycat votes across the continent. But despite the biggest and most divisive advertising campaign in Hungarian history, Orb n failed to entice enough voters to the ballot box.. Early results suggested that about 43.9% of the Hungarian electorate participated, significantly less than the 50% threshold needed to validate the referendum.. This could slow Orb n s political momentum within Europe, said Andr s B r -Nagy, a former EU official, and a fellow at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Today is a sweeping victory for all those who reject the EU s mandatory, unlimited quotas,  said Gergely Guly s.  It is a sweeping victory for all those who believe that the foundations of a strong European Union can only be the strong nation states. . But Fidesz s critics said the party had exaggerated the result. Viktor Szigetv ri, the leader of Egy tt, a liberal opposition party, said:  In his speech, the prime minister failed to recognise the reality. The majority of Hungarians stayed away from the polls and what s been left behind is a divided country. To heal this, we need a change in government. . Analysts said that the low turnout was ultimately underwhelming for a man who bases his arguments on their popular appeal and whose toxic advertising campaign was five times larger than the next biggest in Hungarian history. Of Hungary s 20,000 advertising hoardings, 5,888 were used for the referendum campaign   considerably more than the 1,200 used by a tobacco firm in the mid-1990s, according to research by Transparency International.. Csaba T th, strategy director at the Republikon thinktank, said:  It s a disappointment for him, but it doesn t make it impossible for him to claim it as a victory; there are still more than three million people voting for him. But expectations were higher. Despite the very distorted media landscape, and despite all this advertising, it was only enough to mobilise voters from Fidesz and Jobbik,  a far-right opposition party.. Liberal opposition politicians argued that the referendum was an attempt to distract from Orb n s domestic failures and told their supporters to boycott the vote in order to render it invalid. Questions were raised over the amount of state funds that were used to pay for referendum adverts in government-friendly media outlets or on hoardings owned by government allies.. . . . .

Read more. The government denies any wrongdoing and says the adverts were placed in a  completely transparent  manner. But Transparency International and other academic researchers queried the process.. Attila B torfy, a researcher on media affairs at the Central European University, said:  Channelling state funds to media outlets that are owned by oligarchs allied to the governments and have viewership that is lower their competitors   what s the problem with that? It s using state funds to prop up the government s private media backers, for the purposes of drumming up support for the government s position. . Government critics condemned the divisive tone of Orb n s campaign. He and his colleagues frequently linked refugees to terrorism and relentlessly plugged their message, even during half-time advertising breaks at the European football championships in June.. Zsuzsanna Vajna, a 79-year-old Holocaust survivor who remembers being made to walk up and down the banks of the Danube while Hungarian Nazis shot other Jews into the river, said the stigmatisation of refugees reminded her of the incitement against Jews during her childhood..  It very much feels like the atmosphere in the 30s before the second world war,  Vajna said.  In the 1930s, we were in a very bad economic situation. People had to be blamed, and then it was the Jews. And that s what I m reminded of when I read the Hungarian government s propaganda. It s very dangerous. Because it can contaminate all of Europe. . Additional reporting: Benj min Nov k. . .

Over the past 10 days, bombs have rained down upon the ruins of eastern Aleppo   the besieged districts of Syria s largest city. Unrelenting carnage perpetrated by Russian and Syrian warplanes has left hundreds dead and more than 1,000 wounded, overwhelming the few hospitals still in operation, which are themselves. repeatedly bombed out of service.

Once, her mother crossed the frontline to go to university, but as the road grew more fraught she opted to stay home and help teach.

There are no fruit or vegetables left in the markets, a symptom of the siege that has lasted for three months now, only briefly broken by a rebel offensive that barely got any supplies through their corridor.. There is very little diesel fuel to power the generators that keep the lights on, so the family has set up solar panels that keep the power on in their home.. Bana herself has changed much, her mother said. All she has known for most of her life is conflict and war, and she has grown withdrawn and distracted: four hours of sleep a night for her is a miracle under the bombs. She wants to go outside and go to school, but can do little except sit at home and draw, and play with the neighbours  children.. The seven-year-old again pipes up:  We are children. We love life.

"Japan police probe 48 suspicious deaths after poisoning of two elderly patients"," Two men died in a Yokohama hospital after being fed a chemical through IV drips, prompting an investigation into other cases  Police in  Japan  are investigating the suspicious deaths of 48 elderly patients at the same hospital after autopsies on two of them revealed they had been poisoned by intravenous drips laced with a chemical found in disinfectant.   The murder investigation initially focused on two men who died within days of each other in the middle of last month.

Both had been poisoned, and a tiny hole was found in an IV drip administered to one of them.. The investigation has widened to include 46 other people who have died since the beginning of July, all of whom were being treated on the same floor of Oguchi hospital in Yokohama as the two murdered men, according to Kyodo.. . . . .

Read more. Last week staff found puncture marks in 10 of about 50 unused drip bags stored near the nurses  station on the same floor.. Police have yet to publicly identify a suspect or establish a motive but on Monday, Kyodo quoted unnamed sources close to the investigation saying that the two recent deaths were likely to have been caused by someone with medical expertise who was connected with the hospital.. Nobuo Yamaki and Sozo Nishikawa, both 88, died during a three-day public holiday in mid-September when the 85-bed hospital was lightly staffed. The hospital said its entrance was locked and the building guarded throughout the night.. Autopsies determined that the Yamaki and Nishikawa had been poisoned with a chemical used in a disinfectant found at the nurses station.. Hospital staff were slow to make any connection between the deaths because the facility treats a large number of elderly and terminally ill patients, according to local media.. But one was quoted as saying that pneumonia or other hospital-acquired infections had been ruled out as the cause of the unusually large number of deaths..  We see many people pass away due to the nature of this hospital, but had the impression that the number of those dying was increasing a little,  a hospital official told Kyodo.. Police have conceded that they are unlikely to establish the cause of death in every case since many of the bodies have already been cremated.. The investigation comes two months after Satoshi Uematsu, a former care worker,. killed 19 residents at a care centre for the disabled. Uematsu, a 26-year-old former employee of the facility near Tokyo, had earlier written to the speaker of the lower house of Japan s parliament demanding that the government permit euthanasia for people with disabilities.. After his arrest, he reportedly told police:  It is better that disabled people disappear. . . . More news. Topics. . .

"Trump campaign faces biggest crisis yet after tax documents published"," Republican threatens lawsuit as leaked returns fuel questions over business acumen   and suggest he may have been able to avoid income tax for years  Donald Trump was reeling from the biggest crisis of his campaign on Sunday, after the publication of documents suggesting the wealthy Republican nominee may have been able to escape paying income tax for nearly two decades.   In a direct challenge to his claim to be a successful businessman and a champion of America s hard-working middle class, the  anonymously leaked tax returns  reveal how Trump used aggressive accounting tactics and the failure of several businesses to claim a loss of $916m in his 1995 personal filing.

Read more. Independent experts say under US rules, this could be large enough to legally shelter hundreds of millions in income from years of federal tax   despite Trump s high-rolling lifestyle and criticism of others for avoiding tax.. Trump did not deny the. damning conclusions drawn by the New York Times.  The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained,  the campaign said in a statement,  a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic party and their global special interests. . The editor of the New York Times recently said he was. prepared to risk prison. The veracity of the document was also confirmed by Trump s former accountant, Jack Mitnick, who told the paper he had to manually input the figure in question because tax preparation software did not allow for nine-digit losses.. Instead, the Trump campaign embarked on a damage control exercise on Sunday, dispatching surrogates to television talk shows to argue that Trump was clever to exploit the painful collapse of his past business ventures, several of which. defaulted on creditors by declaring. bankruptcy.  The reality is he s a genius,  former New York mayor and Trump supporter. Rudy Giuliani. The argument is consistent with an explanation given by the candidate himself, who claimed he was being  smart  when pressed by his rival, Hillary Clinton, on tax avoidance during their first presidential debate.. In 2012, Trump berated people who don t pay tax payers,. writing. Yet the scale of the 1995 loss appears to confirm suggestions made by Democrats that Trump has refused to follow 40 years of tradition and publish his tax returns because they would show he didn t pay any..  Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father,  Democratic Senate minority leader Harry Reid said on Sunday..  Despite losing a billion dollars, Trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle-class families who earn their paychecks with hard work. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Many such embarrassments have failed to dent Trump s popularity in the past, but the tax question goes to the heart of his claim to represent struggling US workers.. Trump has proposed a tax plan that would cut taxes for all Americans, but analysis by the. conservative Tax Foundation.  You have middle-class people working longer hours for low wages, they pay their taxes,  said Senator Bernie Sanders, whose battle against Clinton for the Democratic nomination drew on similar anger over inequality..  They support their schools, they support their infrastructure, they support the military, but the billionaires, no, they don t have to do that because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes,  Sanders told ABC on Sunday..  So Trump goes around and says,  Hey, I m worth billions, I m a successful businessman, but I don t pay any taxes, but you, you who earn 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes. That s why people are angry and want real change in this country. .

Schools in the eastern suburbs officially reopened on Saturday, although only a few actually held classes. Residents said weapons such as bunker-buster bombs could damage even schools with underground facilities.. Activists said a school building in the Ma adi district of eastern Aleppo that had been abandoned after being bombed previously was struck again on Sunday, causing no casualties.. One activist in the city said:  The best thing I have seen for 40 days now since the start of the second siege is seeing the children carrying their schoolbags and going to the school. . Wissam Zarqa, a local teacher, said his students had to stay late after school on Sunday because warplanes were flying in the area. But he said he was grateful the children were attempting to live a normal life..

On Saturday the M10 hospital was bombed by Syrian helicopters, and earlier in the week two other emergency centres and the only remaining maternity hospital were bombed from the air.. The escalation in violence has prompted condemnation by Washington, but the US and its allies have little leverage over Russia, with no plan B after the collapse of diplomatic efforts.. Syrian pro-government forces pushed ahead with their ground offensive and took control of new territory in the city s north, according to state TV and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.. Seizing Aleppo would be a major victory for Assad, who is relying on thousands of foreign fighters to prosecute the battle. It would place him in control of Syria s most heavily populated cities, pushing the rebellion against him into rural areas.. The UN said eastern Aleppo was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and expressed deep alarm at the  ferocious pummelling  of the city..  The health system is on the verge of total collapse, with patients being turned away and no medicines available to treat even the most common ailments,  said Stephen O Brien, the undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs.  With clean water and food in very short supply, the number of people requiring urgent medical evacuations is likely to rise dramatically in the coming days. . . . More news. Topics. . .

The locomotive s recorder has information on train speed. NTSB vice-chair T Bella Dinh-Zarr said at a Sunday news conference she was hopeful the data recorder in the cab control car in the front of the train was functional. That has yet to be recovered from the crash site.. Dinh-Zarr said the train s engineer told investigators the train was operating properly before it crashed on Thursday morning.. Thomas Gallagher, a 29-year veteran of the railway who was injured when the train derailed, also said the train was operating at 10mph as it approached the station. He told investigators he was fully rested at the time and had no memory of the accident.. Investigators have said the conductor said he did not see anything unusual about the train s speed.. According to federal data, meanwhile,. New Jersey. Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) information shows that NJ Transit has settled 183 safety violations   ranging from employee drug and alcohol use to violations of railroad operating rules or practices   since 1 January 2011. The settlement payments include about $70,000 for more than a dozen safety violations in 2014 and 2015. Statistics for the current year are not yet available.. Months before Thursday s crash, federal rail officials found dozens of violations during an audit focusing on NJ Transit s safety and operations, a US official confirmed on Saturday.. The official, who was familiar with the railroad administration audit, spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation.. The FRA began an audit in June after noticing an increase in rail incidents and found  dozens of safety violations  that needed to be fixed immediately, the official said.. The commuter rail agency was fined as a result of the audit, the official said, adding that federal agencies are continuing to work with the railroad to ensure compliance with federal rail safety guidelines.. There were 25 accidents in 2015 and 10 in the first seven months of 2016, but none caused injuries or death, federal data showed. Most of the incidents occurred at low speeds and more than half were in train yards.. . . More news. Topics. . .

Read more. Poland already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in. Europe. Were the proposed ban to be enacted, all terminations would be criminalised, with women punishable with up to five years in prison. Doctors found to have assisted with a termination would also be liable for prosecution and a prison term.. Critics say that would mean that even a woman who suffers a miscarriage could be under criminal suspicion, and that doctors might be put off conducting even routine procedures on pregnant women for fear of being accused of facilitating a termination.. Although a ban has received public support from elements of the Catholic church and Poland s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), neither initiated the proposals. They were drafted by hardline conservative advocacy group Ordo Iuris and submitted by the Stop. Abortion. When on 23 September the Polish parliament voted for Stop Abortion s proposals to be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee, pro-choice activists responded by calling a nationwide strike, or  national absence campaign , by women, encouraging them to take a day off work and domestic tasks and gather for meetings or demonstrations, to donate blood or do charity work.. . . . . Poland's rule of law under systematic threat, says EU executive. . . . . 
Read more. Many Polish women say they are sick of deals being cut over their fundamental reproductive and human rights, which they argue threaten both their safety and their dignity..  A lot of women and girls in this country have felt that they don t have any power, that they are not equal, that they don t have the right to an opinion,  said Magda Staroszczyk, a strike co-ordinator.  This is a chance for us to be seen, and to be heard. . Monday s protest was inspired by an all-out strike more than 40 years ago by the women of Iceland, when 90% of women refused to work, cook, or look after their children for a day in October 1975.. Organisers cite an assault on women s reproductive rights that goes beyond the measures contained in Stop Abortion s proposed ban. A separate, PiS-sponsored bill restricting IVF (in vitro fertilisation), which would make it illegal to freeze embryos and allow women to fertilise only one embryo at a time, was also passed to the parliamentary committee stage in September.. The Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements, with the support of an MP from a rightwing parliamentary faction associated with Law and Justice, has called for a total ban of the morning-after pill. Under the proposals, anyone caught selling or distributing emergency contraception could be imprisoned for up to two years.. But it is the perceived cruelty of the proposed abortion ban that has united what has long been a relatively marginal feminist movement with many self-identified Roman Catholics and those who support the existing  compromise    shorthand for the legislation passed in 1993 that regulates abortion to this day..  One thing that I think really radicalised women is when they understood that this could lead to incarceration for women who had miscarriages,  says Agnieszka Graff, a commentator, activist, and author of World without Women: Gender in Polish Public Life.. . . . . Thousands protest against proposed stricter abortion law in Poland. . . . .

According to a poll for Newsweek Polska, 74% of Poles support the retention of the existing legislation, while research by polling company Ipsos indicates 50% of Poles support the strike, with 15% saying they would like to take part. A further 15% expressed opposition..  My mother is very Catholic, goes to church every Sunday, and is against abortion just because you might not want the child,  says Ma gorzata  odyga, a junior doctor who supports the strike.  But she is against this law, because if a woman is raped, she will be treated worse than the man who raped her. . The intensity of the so-called  black protests  has proved tricky for Law and Justice, which presents itself as the guardian of traditional values in a country beset by liberal notions of multiculturalism, relaxed social mores and restrictive political correctness, but which remains mindful of the risks of alienating mainstream public opinion.. The party s leader, Jaros aw Kaczy ski, has suggested that the government might accept a compromise whereby terminations carried out because of a congenital disorder of the foetus would be banned, but terminations of pregnancies as a result of rape or incest would still be permitted.. . .

Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank. Photograph: Saurabh Das/AP. Progress in 2013 was due largely to developments in China, Indonesia and India   leaving half of the world s poor living in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty rates have fallen to 3.5% in East Asia and the Pacific   the region that includes China   and to 15% in South Asia, the region that includes India, but remain at 41% in sub-Saharan Africa.. The Bank found that in 60 of the 83 countries studied, average incomes rose for the bottom 40% between 2008 and 2013 despite the deepest global recession of the post-second world war era.. Amid a growing backlash against globalisation driven by concerns that the rich have captured the gains of free trade, the Bank said global inequality had declined consistently since 1990. The narrowing of the gap has relied on fast growth in the world s biggest developing countries, particularly China and India.. . . . .

In 34 of the 83 countries monitored, income gaps had widened since 2008, with incomes of the richest 60% rising more quickly than those of the poorest 40%.. After studying a group of countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Mali, Peru and Tanzania, the Bank said a six-pronged approach was needed to tackle inequality.. That means:. .  early childhood action focused on better nutrition. universal health coverage. universal access to good schools. cash transfers to poor families. better roads and electrification. progressive taxation to transfer resources from rich to poor..  Some of these measures can rapidly affect income inequality. Others deliver benefits more gradually. None is a miracle cure,  said Kim.  But all are supported by strong evidence, and many are within the financial and technical reach of countries. Adopting the same policies doesn t mean that all countries will get the same results, but the policies we ve identified have worked repeatedly in different settings around the world. . . . More news.

Legal ivory markets across the globe must be urgently closed in order to combat the elephant poaching crisis, according to an agreement struck by 182 nations on Sunday.. The. decision. The. Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species. Domestic ivory markets are a highly controversial issue, but the Cites nations agreed unanimously that every country should  take all necessary legislative, regulatory and enforcement measures to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw and worked ivory as a matter of urgency. . More than 140,000 of Africa s savannah elephants were. killed for their ivory. wiping out almost a third of their population.  There is no legal market that doesn t contribute to the illegal trade,  said Susan Lieberman, at the Wildlife. Conservation. Robert Hepworth, a former chair of Cites  top committee and now at the David Shepherd. Wildlife. The final wording of the decision was a compromise and specified domestic ivory markets that are  contributing to poaching or illegal trade , a potential loophole. Daniela Freyer, at the Pro Wildlife group, said:  Today s decision is a step forward. However, the European Union and a small minority of southern African countries are to be blamed for watering down the motion. Elephants deserve better. .  We believe domestic ivory markets are driving poaching across Africa,  said Patrick Omondi, a member of the delegation from Kenya, which co-chairs the African Elephant Coalition, a group of 29 countries which want a crackdown on the ivory trade.  But we are happy with the decision: it was the best we could get. . China, the largest domestic ivory market, had argued against the loophole, a move seen as major progress. It has. already committed to close its own ivory markets. Environmental Investigation Agency report claims to show evidence of illegal activity. International pressure to close domestic ivory markets is building. Nations at a major conservation summit in September also. agreed the domestic trade in ivory should end. move fell short of the total ban. US imposed a near total domestic ban. The Cites nations also agreed for the first time that destruction is an option for the disposal of seized ivory stockpiles, a course already taken by 22 nations. There was further action as well on countries which seen as failing to tackle the illegal ivory trade, with tougher reporting requirements. Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon and Nigeria should all have reported on the measures they are implementing, but have not.. The most controversial debates on the poaching crisis will come on Monday, when Cites decides on a proposal by southern African nations to overturn the ban on selling ivory and a rival proposal from 29 other African countries which aims to elephant protections even stricter.. . .

Hopes for an end to Spain s nine-month political deadlock have risen after the shattered Socialist Workers  party deposed its leader over his pointblank refusal to allow the acting prime minister to form a government.. Pedro S nchez, who had. fought to retain the leadership of the PSOE. His plan to hang on to his job by holding a leadership contest in three weeks  time was eventually rejected by 132 votes to 107 at the end of an 11-hour session that laid bare the chaos and anger at the heart of the PSOE.. Shortly afterwards, S nchez announced his resignation and the party was put in the hands of a caretaker leadership that will have to decide soon on its next step as a deadline looms for avoiding Spain s third general election in just over a year.. S nchez had consistently argued that the party would not do anything to support or facilitate the return to government of Mariano Rajoy s conservative People s party, on the grounds that the PP had wrought too much damage on Spanish society and was. hopelessly mired in corruption scandals. It was a stance that infuriated not only many voters  . and the media. disastrous electoral performance.  As I said yesterday and as I m saying again today, my parents taught me that the most important thing is keeping your word,  S nchez said.  That was my word, which I gave to all the members and to the federal committee, too, when it came to the party s position on Rajoy s investiture process. . On Wednesday, hours before. half of the executive committee resigned. Like many in the party, Gonz lez urged S nchez to let Rajoy govern. Susana D az, the leader of the PSOE in Andaluc a and the candidate most frequently touted as S nchez s successor, also insisted that the needs of the country had to come before the needs of the party.. The PSOE now has a month to regroup and re-evaluate its position before King Felipe could dissolve parliament and call. new elections to be held at Christmas. Although the removal of S nchez could help end the political paralysis, his departure is likely to prove a pyrrhic victory for D az and her supporters. The civil war that has torn the socialists apart will only serve to strengthen Rajoy s hand and boost the appeal of Podemos, the anti-austerity party that has long dreamed of replacing the PSOE as the strongest voice of the Spanish left.. Pablo Sim n, a political science professor at Madrid s Carlos III University, said the PSOE had been left  mortally wounded  by the week s events and in no mood for third elections in which they would suffer even further..  The Socialist party is so weakened, so destroyed and so ripped apart that all it can do is limp on,  he said.  If it s going to negotiate, it can only do so with its hands up. . Reports suggest the PP will ask the socialists for far more than just a smooth investiture. Safe in the knowledge that he could use fresh elections to crush his party s longstanding rivals, Rajoy is likely to extract the maximum possible gains from any deal..  His conditions are going to be very harsh,  said Sim n.  It seems he s going to look for their support to make sure he has four easy years in office. . He predicted those who had helped oust S nchez were unlikely to find their efforts rewarded.  There s a whole generation of socialist leaders who have damaged themselves with this move: Susana D az, Guillermo Fern ndez Vara [the PSOE president of Extremadura] and Eduardo Madina [a former leadership candidate] are all divisive figures within the party now,  he said..  Whoever leads the party into the next phase needs to be someone completely new and unstained by the conspiracy. . Sim n said S nchez s replacement faced an almost insurmountable task.  The wound the PSOE has sustained is going to be very hard to cure and will need many electoral cycles to heal. I get the feeling that we re heading for a long cycle of government by the right in.

What made this whole thing even more absurd is that all of the above comments were made, not in the magazine, but on a blog at vogue.com. So is being a blogger OK if you also write in a magazine? If you don t pose for photographs? We shall never know because, while the internet may have infinite space, there didn t seem to be enough to address these distinctions.. Needless to say, this little hoo-ha has attracted a fair amount of attention. First, unsurprisingly, from some of the aforementioned bloggers, such as Susanna Lau, also known as Susie Bubble.  Bloggers who wear borrowed clothes are merely doing the more overt equivalent of that editorial-credit system, . Bubble tweeted. Here, I suspect, is what s really going on: you re all getting played. You, somewhat stunned and hurt bloggers, who woke up one morning and found Vogue had launched a missile right at your Instagram page, and you, absurd commentators, who have just given Vogue yet more publicity in your grandstanding column. Despite the sneery suggestions to the contrary, the editors at Vogue are no fools   in fact, some of the smartest women I ve met in journalism work at US Vogue, which might explain why it s retained its position as the globally pre-eminent fashion magazine for decades while nearly every other publication on the planet is in its death throes. They also know that having a reputation for being the Mean Girls of the fashion world does them no harm.. Anna Wintour. I m sure many fashion magazine editors do find the street-style stars and bloggers annoying. Their blatant attention-seeking antics are so the antithesis of these magazines  preferred technique for a woman to get noticed   which is to be thinner, prettier or at least richer than everyone else   they may as well have come from a different planet. But these editors  complaints were far too blunt to be anything but calculated. And look at the result: US Vogue has been the talk of the international media for the past 10 days, throughout Milan and Paris fashion weeks, with no one giving a fig about any of the other magazines.

Afghans constituted the second-largest group of asylum seekers in Europe, with. 196,170 applying. While the text stipulates a maximum of 50 non-voluntary deportees per chartered flight in the first six months after the agreement, there is no limit to the number of daily deportation flights European governments can charter to Kabul.. With tens of thousands set to be deported, both sides will also consider building a terminal dedicated to deportation flights at Kabul international airport..

There was no chance to mount resistance against it,  Schuster said.. The large exodus of Afghans last year seemed partly triggered by. Angela Merkel opening Germany s doors to almost a million migrants. On Sunday, the Taliban mounted a. strong assault. To prevent a migrant flow of the size experienced last year, the deal commits the EU to help fund public awareness campaigns in Afghanistan warning against the dangers of migrating.. However, not all Afghan asylum seekers arrive to Europe from Afghanistan. An unknown number were born or grew up in Iran or Pakistan. If sent to Afghanistan, many are likely to struggle without the social networks that are often a prerequisite to getting work, even for the well-educated. According to Schuster, who has authored a. paper on post-deportation experience.  There is not sufficient protection, the level of generalised violence is too high and Kabul is already bursting at the seams,  Schuster said..  This particular agreement allows European governments to ride straight through all the argumentation that s been made over the past 15 years that it s not safe to return people at the moment. . . .

"How is Hurricane Matthew affecting you? Share your experiences"," The strongest hurricane in the Atlantic in almost a decade is expected to hit Haiti and Jamaica. If you re in the region, tell us what it s like  Hurricane Matthew   the strongest in the Atlantic in almost a decade   is  expected to hit Haiti and Jamaica on Monday , according to the US National Hurricane Center. The category-four hurricane could bring up to 64 cm (25 inches) of rain and winds of up to 240km/h (150mph) which could trigger life-threatening landslides and floods.  Haiti has begun evacuating residents from high-risk areas but those living in the La Savane neighborhood close to water refused to move out of their homes despite being just a few miles from where the hurricane is forecast to land.

Nemtsov, who was deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, had been a fierce critic of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and was set to lead a protest on 1 March 2015, two days after he was. shot four times. The defendants, who were allegedly contracted to carry out the killing, all deny the charges.. Nemtsov s family fear that whoever ordered the hit will not be found. Their lawyers told the court that the investigation was neither effective nor comprehensive.. A lawyer for Zaur Dadayev, a former deputy commander of the Sever security forces battalion in Chechnya, who allegedly fired the gun, told the court that he was innocent. Dadayev reportedly confessed to the crime after he was detained, but later said he. had been tortured. Another suspect blew himself up with a grenade when police tried to arrest him in Grozny in March 2015. Prosecutors alleged the men had been paid 15m roubles ( 190,000) to commit the crime, but the murder weapon had not been found.. Lawyers for Nemtsov s family said the investigation was incomplete and not all those guilty were on the defendants  bench. In several previous high-profile killings of government critics, assassins have been brought to trial, but not those suspected of contracting them.. The prosecution lawyer Olga Mikhailova told the court:  It s necessary to establish those who ordered [the killing]   The motive for the crime has not been established. . Mikhailova noted that Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Moscow. leader of Chechnya. Ruslan Mukhudinov, a driver for officers of the Sever battalion, who was charged by investigators with organising the crime, has not been arrested.. The defence lawyer Zaurbek Sadakhanov asked the court:  Can a driver order the deputy commander of the battalion to commit a crime? . Nemtsov s associates and supporters have previously said the charges against Mukhudinov suggested an attempt to cover up the potential involvement of higher-level Chechen figures.. Dadayev was a member of the Sever battalion until the day after Nemtsov s killing and security experts said he could not have committed such a crime without approval from the Chechen leadership..

The rightwing prime minister, Viktor Orb n, waged the biggest advertising campaign in Hungarian history in an attempt to convince people to vote against welcoming 1,294 refugees allocated to. Hungary. Throughout the campaign, Orb n and his allies associated refugees with terrorists.  No one can say how many terrorists have arrived so far among the immigrants,  said. a state-sponsored pamphlet. In response to the campaign, Andr s Heisler, the head of Mazsihisz,. the largest Jewish umbrella organisation in Hungary. Citing the  historical experience  of Jews, Heisler feared that the stigmatisation of migrants could lead to the alienation of other Hungarian minorities..  For us, it is not acceptable to incite hatred against not only Jews but also against Roma people, Christians, gays, or migrants,  Heisler said.  As we know hatred behaves like a virus: it can [slowly] make sick the whole of society. . Diana Groo, a Hungarian director who makes films about Jewish history, said:  The campaign of hatred reminds me very much of the Nazi propaganda, and the film. Der Ewige Jude. Heisler said he agreed with his colleague, Rabbi Zolt n Radn ti, who argued that the rights of refugees should not be up for discussion in a post-Holocaust context.  It should [be] evident in the post-Shoah. Europe. During the referendum campaign the government placed nearly 6,000 anti-refugee adverts in public spaces   five times more than the next-biggest advertising campaign in Hungarian history.. . . . . Hungary's refugee referendum not valid after voters stay away. . . . .

More than 98% of participants voted against refugees, but. just 40% of the electorate cast valid votes. undermining Orb n s campaign for a Europe-wide rebellion. Orb n portrayed the vote as a victory, but on Monday European politicians highlighted that he had failed to secure the 50% turnout needed to validate the process..  If the referendum had been legally valid, our comment would have been that we take note of it,  the chief spokesman for the European commission, Margaritis Schinas, pointedly said.  Since it was declared legally void by the Hungarian electoral commission, we can now say that we also take note of it. . Other leading European figures, including the foreign ministers of Italy and Luxembourg, also emphasised that Orb n had failed to encourage enough voters to the ballot box. In Hungary, the low turnout was criticised by the leader of the largest opposition party, Jobbik, a far-right group with even more extreme views than Orb n..  Since yesterday you have become a failed politician,  G bor Vona told Orb n in parliament on Monday.  You will not be taken seriously by Brussels bureaucrats  Brussels will ruthlessly exploit your irresponsibility and mistake. .

It s very dangerous,  said Zsuzsanna Vajna, a Holocaust survivor who nearly starved to death in the Budapest ghetto in 1945.  Hitler was saying the same things in the 30s, inciting hatred against one part of the population. Now [the victims] are the migrants, the Muslims. It s a very violent campaign that s been going on for more than a year, and has torn apart a country. . During the winter of 1944, Vajna was forced to walk at gunpoint with other Jews up and down the banks of the Danube, while Hungarian Nazis shot some of them into the river at random. A few hundred metres from this spot on Saturday, several hundred far-right protesters held an anti-refugee rally in one of Budapest s most famous squares.

The plebiscite is the latest in a series of aggressive political responses to the economic crisis that threatens to undermine a government which has long staked its authority on being able to provide material benefits, if not civil rights, to its population.. Before the vote the government stepped up its harassment of independent journalists and dissidents to the point that Azerbaijan s civil society was described as  paralysed  and facing  the worst situation  since the country s independence in 1991, the UN human rights rapporteur. Michel Forst said during a recent visit. Reports of increasing repression are not surprising in Azerbaijan, long one of the former Soviet Union s most authoritarian states.

The Formula 1 Grand Prix racing through Baku in June. Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images. This spring. the government released more than a dozen. Altay Goyushov, a historian and. one of Azerbaijan s leading public intellectuals. But Goyushov and others agree that the political changes feel cosmetic, merely a tactical shift aimed at securing concessions from the west.. They say that whatever political retreat the Azerbaijani state has made is the result of the economic crisis. For the last 15 years, soaring oil prices and substantial Caspian Sea. . The government thoroughly rearmed the military, held high-profile international events such as the Eurovision song contest and the first European Games, and invested in architectural prestige projects,. such as the $250m Zaha Hadid. But the recent oil price collapse has inflicted serious damage. Over the last year and a half the currency, the manat, has lost half its value. Baku is reportedly. angling for loans and bailouts from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. According to Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter and the best-known of the political prisoners released this spring, the Azerbaijani government  needs money   and western institutions that can give it will probably do it conditionally    by demanding transparency and the rights of private groups to monitor them..  This is why the government is now trying to give more space to NGOs, but it s all an imitation. They release people but they don t let the NGOs operate,  she said.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Ismayilova, who had produced explosive investigative reports exposing high-level corruption in the Azerbaijani government,. was arrested in 2014 on charges of  inciting suicide . she wrote a piece for the Washington Post. But that s exactly what happened, she says.  This imitation works. You see that western governments are believing in some sort of softening. Diplomats whom I ve talked to speak about it openly, they say they see signs of softening, and I always warn them that it s an imitation. . . . . . I m afraid that Europe s defence of human rights is just words than deeds. The political prisoners are part of this game. . Hilal Mamedov. . . That view is shared by another of the released prisoners, Hilal Mamedov. The mathematics professor, a member of the Talysh minority (a Persian-speaking group that lives along Azerbaijan s border with Iran), is an advocate for Talysh rights and the editor of a Talysh-language newspaper. He was arrested after. posting a video on YouTube. After the video became an unlikely viral hit in the Russian-speaking world, gaining more than 20m views, Mamedov joked on Facebook that while the government had spent millions to hold Eurovision, he made Azerbaijan famous for free. Days later he was arrested and charged with heroin possession. After nearly four years in prison, he was released this spring..  The leadership of the country thinks that they need to be a little more cautious with the US and Europe,  he says.  For example, if before we often heard criticisms against the US, today you almost never hear that. . But he, too, fears that he is being used as a bargaining chip when there is little hope of real change.  I m afraid that   Europe s defence of human rights is more in words than deeds,  he said.

One illustrative incident took place in March, when Aliyev visited Washington for the nuclear security summit, two weeks after freeing 15 of the political prisoners. In DC,. he got a photo with Barack Obama. That Aliyev managed to get a meeting with Biden demonstrated  the commodification of political prisoners   especially the rock stars like Khadija [Ismayilova] ,  said Richard Kauzlarich, a former US ambassador to Baku and now a professor at George Mason University.. The fact that the US is so easily swayed by cosmetic reforms demonstrates that their interest in Azerbaijan becoming more democratic is also cosmetic, Goyushev says. Western policymakers have long seen Azerbaijan primarily in geopolitical terms, as a pro-western outpost wedged between Russia and Iran, and providing oil and natural gas.  In the short term, it s not important [to the west] that Azerbaijan be democratic,  Goyushev says.. . . . . Freed journalist Khadija Ismayilova: 'They didn't succeed in silencing me'. . . . .

Even the Khartoum Breast Care Centre (KBCC), the Horn of Africa s first and only dedicated breast cancer clinic, has been hit by the sanctions, with a ban on international money transfers and the restriction on imports of medical equipment and spare parts.. Founded by. British-trained Sudanese radiologist Dr Hania Fadl. Using private funds and a $14m donation from the charitable foundation run by her ex-husband, Sudanese-British businessman. Mo Ibrahim. However, the US sanctions meant the centre was unable to buy and maintain crucial diagnostic machinery. In February 2014, it decided to begin a year-long application process for a US Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) exemption, which would make it easier to maintain its General Electric digital mammography machine.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
A doctor at the KBCC clinic in Khartoum. Photograph: Muhammed Salah/Elephant Media. During the application process the machine broke down. It ended up being out of action for 10 weeks. The clinic was paralysed, with doctors forced to use alternative screening methods.  The problem is the poor women. You do ultrasounds and biopsies but an ultrasound is not an internationally approved screening modality,  Fadl says.  There are patients and I have to do something, even if they ll put me in jail. I can t let them wait and risk that their cancers spread. . After heavy campaigning and several trips to Washington by Fadl to meet members of Congress, Ofac eventually issued a blanket licence exempting all medical equipment in Sudan from sanctions.. . . . . Ignorance is rife and I really hope and pray that women will come to the centre at least for a simple check up. . Fatma Abdelmajid, KBCC patient. . . The result was a welcome surprise to doctors at the KBCC, who say the move is a milestone for Sudanese healthcare in that it has put the needs of patients above international politics..  All of our equipment in the clinic is from a US company, General Electric, as are the majority of advanced medical machines in Sudan. For there to be an exemption from sanctions, our lives as doctors will be much easier and the lives our patients will drastically change,  says Dr David Lawis, medical director of the KBCC.. Lawis says access to radiotherapy remains a huge issue, with just two machines in the country. One, in Khartoum a hospital, has been broken for about seven months. The second is in Madani hospital, two hours  drive from Khartoum.. Anyone who can afford to pay for treatment abroad usually leaves Sudan to get radiotherapy, but the blanket Ofac licence has the potential to change this.  People won t have to leave their country to get the treatment they deserve,  says Lawis.. Word of mouth. Other challenges remain, however, and Fadl says the battle to educate and inform women about self-examination and the local availability of affordable treatment is the next healthcare frontier..  We did a little survey to ask the women how they heard about us. We found that the most effective, at 49%, was word of mouth. We are still a tribal community: we trust relatives, friends and neighbours who tell us  I went to that place and it is good . We don t have that culture of research on the internet,  says Fadl.. This was the case for 60-year-old Sudanese patient Fatma Abdelmajid, who regularly takes a six-hour bus from Atbara in north-east Sudan to Khartoum for treatment after a local doctor told her that  one of Atbara s boys  worked at the KBCC clinic..  The mentality around breast cancer here is absolutely wrong. When you tell women in the village that you ve been diagnosed, they are so disturbed as if you re about to drop dead in front of them. It s really sad,  says Abdelmajid..  They tell you, go to a. fakeeh. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

An estimated 60% of the 2,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer who die each year could have survived if given proper care.. Fadl strongly believes that stories like Abdelmajid s will help end the taboo that often stops women from seeking a diagnosis.  A woman who has the experience of being treated should tell her stories, to new patients here at the centre and women in their villages. The best thing is to have these examples and success stories,  she says.. Fadl, who lives above the centre in Khartoum, patrols the corridors every day, greeting patients.  If I just walk downstairs and see the patients, see their kindness and deep gratitude, I just can t help but want to help them. Sudanese women deserve everything I do   really and truly.

" Here I have nobody : life in a strange country may be worse than Guant namo"," Sent to a remote border town in a strange country, Lutfi Bin Ali describes an isolated existence haunted by 13 years in the world s most notorious prison  On really bad days, Lutfi Bin Ali retrieves his Guant namo Bay suit from under a pile of clothes and pulls it on.

Sometimes, though, he wonders if his current predicament might actually be even worse than the 13 years he spent in the notorious prison. Lonely and isolated in the Kazakh steppe, the 51-year-old Tunisian has found life since his release from Guant namo no easier than life inside..  At least in Gu ntanamo there were people to talk to. Here I have nobody,  Bin Ali said during the Guardian s two-day visit to his new home, a dusty town in northern. Kazakhstan. . Semey, Kazakhstan. Bin Ali was captured on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in late 2001, and claims to have spent time in CIA black sites before being transferred to Guant namo several months later. US intelligence accused him of associating with known al-Qaida members in Afghanistan and of being part of a Tunisian jihadi cell. He denied all the claims, insisting he went to. Pakistan. According to a. leaked Guant namo internal assessment. As the Obama administration has attempted to shut down Guant namo, increased efforts have been. made to transfer the detainees to their home nations, or third countries. Many former prisoners, Yemenis, Tunisians and Libyans, have been transferred to third countries where they are placed in rehabilitation programmes.. Usually they are funded by the host country, but the Kazakhstan programme is financed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The two-year programme was meant to see the former prisoners slowly integrate into Kazakh society. The reality has been rather different.. Bin Ali has a serious heart condition that required an operation to install an artificial valve in 1999, and his US lawyer, Mark Denbeaux, said he had persuaded Bin Ali to accept the transfer to Kazakhstan based on what US authorities told him..  They explained to me that Kazakhstan was a Muslim country, it had an excellent healthcare system, and they had a programme to take care of him. After two years he would be free to leave. None of what I was told turned out to be true,  Denbeaux said.. . . . . When I arrived, it was -30 outside and I was still in Guantanamo flip-flops. .

Lutfi Bin Ali at his home in Semey. Photograph: Shaun Walker for the Guardian. At the end of 2014, Bin Ali, along with another Tunisian detainee and three Yemenis, were transferred to Kazakhstan. The five were flown out on a military aircraft, hands and feet cuffed, and two days and several changes of transport later, Bin Ali and one of the Yemenis arrived in Semey, a town near Kazakhstan s border with Russia. The other three were sent to Kyzylorda, hundreds of miles away in southern Kazakhstan.. After the long journey, Bin Ali was taken to a temporary apartment in Semey late on New Year s Eve. Outside there were fireworks and drunken celebrations. Inside, it was freezing..  It was minus 30 outside and I was still in Guant namo flip-flops, because none of the shoes they had were big enough. I was expecting a Muslim country and it wasn t what I expected,  he said.. Semey, called Semipalatinsk until 2007, is a sleepy town of dilapidated Soviet-era apartment blocks home to around 300,000 people, more than 500 miles from Kazakhstan s largest city, Almaty. It is mainly known for its location next to the  poligon , an area of steppe where the Soviets carried out nuclear tests. Radiation levels are still well above average in the area, and many believe the tests have led to all manner of health problems.. . Where have other Guant   namo releasees been sent?. The town s isolation and its climate of hot, dusty summers and punishingly cold winters drove Fyodor Dostoevsky to distraction during the five years he spent in exile in the town, where he had seizures and sank into depression.  I live in Semipalatinsk, which bores me to death. Life has become intolerable for me,  the novelist wrote in a letter in 1858.. More than 150 years later, Bin Ali has similar feelings about the town. Few people speak English and he has found only one person, the imam of the mosque, who speaks any Arabic. At 6ft 6in (198cm), he is a foot taller than most of the town s residents, and cannot find shoes or clothes to fit.. After their arrival, the Guant namo five were told they would not be able to leave the confines of their host cities, and Bin Ali was not given proper care for his heart condition.. Four months after the men were transferred, one of the Yemenis in Kyzylorda, Asim al-Khalaqi, became ill.  He was more and more ill but they didn t believe it,  said Adel Hkimi, another Yemeni transferred to Kyzylorda, by telephone.  He was weak. He couldn t go out, so I did shopping for him. I asked to stay overnight to look after him but they wouldn t let me. He became sadder and angrier. He was unable to walk, or to go to the toilet. . Finally, when it became clear just how serious the condition was, Khalaqi was taken to hospital.. He died the next day. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
The town of Semey, close to the Russian border. Photograph: Shaun Walker for the Guardian. Suffering from worsening heart palpitations that kept him awake at night, Bin Ali feared the same fate. Eventually, earlier this year, he was given an operation to install another artificial valve in Astana, Kazakhstan s capital. The whole week he was there he was guarded by police..  They picked him up, broke him, and threw him away,  said Denbeaux of the US treatment of Bin Ali. He said while the conditions in Kazakhstan might be intolerable, the Kazakhs had been  doing the Americans a favour  by agreeing to take the detainees, and it was the US who must bear responsibility for the situation.  In their race to empty out Guant namo, they are leaving people who are released in unsustainable circumstances. . Some Kazakh officials resent the complaints. After all, Bin Ali could well be a dangerous terrorist as far as they know, and he has been given an allowance, access to medicines and a spacious flat that is luxurious by local standards, with green faux-leather sofas and imitation malachite columns.. But it is little more than a gilded cell. His only document is a flimsy, handwritten Kazakh docket saying he is  a person seeking refugee status , and he is explicitly banned from leaving the confines of the town, let alone the country. When the Guardian visited, the police arrived within half an hour, ostensibly to  say hello . They demanded information on the visitor and took down passport and accreditation details.. . Only 55 of the 174 prisoners released from Guant namo since 2008 have been returned to their country of origin.  I think they have good conditions in their daily life. The problem is they have no future there, and that has to do with the restrictions of the Kazakh government,  said Jens-Martin Mehler of the ICRC s regional delegation in central Asia.. It is understandable that the Kazakhs are suspicious. A report issued last week. suggested nine Guant namo detainees have rejoined militant groups since 2009. Bin Ali insists there is no truth to allegations that he had links to al-Qaida. He readily admits he got into scrapes with the law before his arrest, but says they were all about petty crime rather than extremism. Born in 1965 in Tunis, he left school at 12 and worked as a furniture maker. As he turned 20 he moved to Italy on the suggestion of friends and relatives and began a 14-year period moving around the country from Milan to Brindisi.. In 1998 he decided to move to Pakistan. In his telling, he was motivated by cash, not Islam.  I did business with a lot of Pakistan people, I heard there was lots of good business there.  When he got there, he had problems with the police and fled to Afghanistan. He said he spent only a month in Afghanistan, during which time he had no contact with any terrorists and never handled a weapon. He had decided the whole venture was pointless and wanted to return to Italy, via Pakistan. He was arrested by Pakistani forces in a town just across the border.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Lufti bin Ali wants to open a small restaurant selling Italian food some day. Photograph: Shaun Walker for the Guardian. It is possible that Bin Ali s portrayal of himself as a wheeler dealer and occasional petty criminal could be a cover, but little in the leaked Guant namo documents seems to suggest any hard evidence against him, and he has never been brought before any kind of court to answer any charges.. In his new life in Semey, he has almost no company except Sabri al-Qurashi, the Yemeni Guant namo detainee. He has learned basic Russian but locals are afraid of talking to him.. When he is in a good mood, he enjoys cooking, although he wishes he had more people to cook for. For a visiting Guardian journalist he cooked numerous imitations of Italian dishes, which were impressive given the limitations of locally available ingredients..  Cooking is my passion. I dream of cooking for 10 or 20 people. I want to open a small restaurant here, it would be wonderful. I d do Italian food, and Sabri could do the desserts, the cakes. But the local authorities said no. They don t want us to be visible. . Instead, he has busied himself with painting. He also wants to write a Guant namo memoir, but he struggles to concentrate and has trouble using a computer due his poor vision, damaged during his stay in Gu ntanamo.  It feels like there is a football match going on inside my head,  he said.. Often, he sits at home in the dark. His toes are mangled from years of walking barefoot on prison floors and being held in stress positions, and he walks with a pronounced limp. He cuts a forlorn, incongruous figure as he shuffles through the streets of Semey.. Sometimes he thinks about putting on his orange suit, sealing his mouth with tape, and going into the main square to announce he is on hunger strike, until he receives a transfer somewhere else. He has decided against it though, on the basis that it would probably land him in a Kazakh jail, and he is not sure anyone would notice anyway..  I m not angry, I just wish I would be left alone. I am 51 years old, my heart is as weak as a bird s heart, and I am in constant pain. I think all the time about a wife, about making some kids. Will I ever have the chance to live a normal life? . . . More features. Topics. . .

"Removal of the heart: how Islam became a matter of state in Iran"," Some academics argue the Safavid Shahs gave Iranian Shiism a rule-fixation and abandonment of spirituality it has never lost  The crowning of Ismail as king of Iran in Tabriz in 1501 was low-key, as was his announcement that Shia Islam would henceforth be the official state religion. And yet this was a turning-point in Iranian history, with repercussions up to the present day.   Like most Iranians the Safavids (1501-1722) were Sunni, although like many outside Shi ism they venerated Imam Ali (601-661), the first of the 12 Shia imams.

Like most Iranians the Safavids (1501-1722) were Sunni, although like many outside Shi ism they venerated Imam Ali (601-661), the first of the 12 Shia imams. The Sufi orders, sometimes based on trades or guilds, were the main way religion was organised, and they encouraged self-discipline, spirituality and mysticism in varying degrees.. Historians have differed on the nature of Iran s  conversion  under the Safavids: was. Iran. Making Shi ism the state religion served to distinguish Iranians from subjects of the rival Sunni-ruled Ottoman Empire. And importing what was largely a foreign creed restricted to centres in Bahrain, Iraq and Syria lessened the risk of any state religion exacerbating rivalries among Iranian tribes or the Safavids  supporters.. In creating a new order the Safavids looked to Shia Islamic law and to the jurists (mujtahids) specialised in it. This suited their aim of giving Iran cohesion, rules and a strong state, but they also turned their backs on their own origins as Sufis and put in train tensions that have persisted for centuries. In Converting Persia, issued in paperback last year, Rula Abisaab, of McGill University, notes:. . Even though distinguished jurists were in general revered and emulated, the clerical community as a whole, with its varying judicial ranks, were at times the center [sic] of ridicule and disdain among common Persians. Proponents of folk Sufism attracted a significant following along the lower classes, which perceived them as more genuine, altruistic, austere and generous than the jurists. These contradictory developments reflected a social protest against state support of the mujtahids, who manipulated the power to  discipline  for self-interest and greed.. Iran today still shows a popular scepticism about mujtahids, or clerics, commonly called mullahs: think of. Marmoulak. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

In Islam without Allah?, published in 2000, Colin Turner, of Durham University, argued the Safavid dynasty in its haste to establish a strong state not only assigned priority to Islamic jurisprudence over all other branches of knowledge like philosophy or science, but thereby abstracted public adherence to rules from internal religious belief.. For Turner, this Safavid  externalism  gave the Iranian state a deep-seated character that has persisted ever since:. . The designation  internalist  is intended to denote any Muslim writer or thinker whose scholarly attention was focused primarily on the fundamentals of belief (. ) and dissemination of knowledge of God and His attributes (. ). In this sense, internalism has often been articulated best by those attached in some way or other to Sufism and Sufi orders By contrast, the term  externalist  is used to signify those Muslim scholars whose primary consideration was the acquisition and promulgation of the  secondary sciences . Turner traces the dichotomy back to the Quran, which he argues makes a distinction - oddly clearer in English because unlike Arabic it has capital letters - between  islam  (small i), which is internal submission to God based on. iman. faqih. iman. But throughout Islamic history, writes Turner, some thinkers have emphasised the limited nature of jurisprudence and its practitioners, the. fuqaha. faqih. . According to Ghazali. jurisprudence is connected with religion only indirectly The regulation of social life and form of government are secondary   albeit indispensable   adjuncts to the fundamentals of belief, and it is the regulation of social life and government, with its myriad rules and laws, that form the domain of the jurist. The heart is removed from this domain, since attention is focused only on the outward confession (Islam) and not the inward intention.. Turner illustrates Ghazali s jaundiced view of many jurists in a quote that they disdained other disciplines like medicine because they did not involve  the management of religious endowments (. awqaf. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Initially, the Safavids brought clerics from the Arab world, particularly Jabal Amil in what is now south Lebanon, but gradually a new breed of Iranian Shia. faqih. shaykh al-Islam. According to Turner,  it was under Majlisi that Twelver Shi ite externalism became truly orthodox, while all other views were rejected and often forcibly repressed :. . One of Majlisi s first acts was to destroy the idols of a Hindu temple that had been set up by Indian merchants in the capital the heartbroken Hindu keeper of the temple consequently committed suicide Majlisi also obtained a decree for the expulsion of Sufis from the capital, which was rigidly enforced  Majlisi wrote several decrees on the correct way of performing the canonical prayer (. ), on the treatment of.  and on the rules of fasting. Such works of jurisprudence were the stock-in-trade of the externalists.. Majlisi wrote mainly in Persian rather than Arabic, giving his works a wider audience. In these he didn t just clarify issues of prayer and alms giving, he strongly condemned Sufi practices like singing, dancing, vegetarianism and seclusion.. The question raised by works such as Turner and Abisaab is where popular, internal religiosity went. For Turner, identification with the 12 Shia Imams was encouraged to fill the gap:. . Conveying simple, uncluttered dogma in the language of the common people   whom he was said to despise   he [Majlisi] was able to fill the spiritual vacuum that had appeared as a result of the decline of Sufi brotherhoods with treatise after treatise on the lives, sayings, trials, tribulations, miracles and powers of the Imams Twelver Shi ism under the auspices of Majlisi became truly orthodox, and all other views were rejected and often forcibly repressed. True to his externalist ideals, Majlisi preached that.  was incomplete without belief in the Imam  . Even before Majlisi, who lived in the latter part of the Safavid dynasty before its overthrow by Afghan invaders in 1722, the Safavids fostered the. mourning rituals of Ashura. Mashhad. But not completely. There often has been those challenging officialdom and its rulings. Many Iranians, including Mohammad Shah (1834-48), were attracted by Sufism in one form or another, and in the 19th century Mirza Husayn-Ali Nuri   known as Bahaullah - gained many followers for the mysticism of what became the Bahai sect, which today claims 5 million adherents worldwide but has faced consistent persecution in Iran.. The clerics still show nervousness over popular spiritualism, even when it is related to the 12 Imams. In his 2005 presidential election campaign Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. played off. maddahs. Mohammad-Ali Abtahi. But the most successful figure in linking Shia jurisprudence to popular religiosity has surely been Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In a 1993 essay, Said Amir Arjomand noted,  Khomeini s interest in theosophy (. erfan. Khomeini s lifelong interest in. erfan. For Turner, Mulla Sadra was a  notable example  of an  internalist  with a focus on  the fundamentals of belief (. usul al-iman. iman. Ali Shariati. .  In Safavid Shi ism, says Shariati,. .  entails spiritual and practical submission to the status quo Shariati was able to identify the problems of externalism yet, instead of advocating a return to fundamentals in the manner adumbrated by Ghazali and Mulla Sadra, set about prescribing a whole new set of values which, although appearing to be totally divorced from what he calls the stagnation of Safavid Shi ite externalism, in practice amount to little more than a variation on the same theme  . . Reaction against the political quietism of Majlisi and his fellow. can be seen as a major factor in the acquisitions by twentieth-century Twelver Shi ism of a new and revolutionary face a Shi ism that, by stressing politics rather than. , and revolution rather than weeping over the death of Husayn, continues, deliberately or unwittingly as the case may be, to champion the externalism discourse and obfuscate the eternal truths and realities of. .. The seeds had been sown by the Safavids. In her 2002 Mystics, Monarchs and Messiahs, which sought to highlight the rich diversity and intense religiosity the Safavids lost, Kathryn Babayan wrote:. .  with the Safavid patronage of Shi i scholars, judges and preachers, the foundations of a religious establishment were actualized (sic)   These Shi i scholars challenged charismatic mystics in the absence of the hidden Imam, these specialists not only claimed direct access to God; some would argue that political rule was reserved for them as well.

It was a kind of a social contract, but on sending troops to Kabul, Leonid Brezhnev broke it.. More than 15,000 Soviet soldiers were killed between 1979 and 1989, and it is this history that makes President Vladimir Putin s decision to launch a military operation in. Syria. In 2013, Putin decided to help Bashar al-Assad, Syria s president,.  by seeking a compromise with the west. However, three years later the Kremlin is no longer playing the role of an intermediary, but fighting on the side of the Damascus government,. actively taking part in the confrontation. At one time, Putin s supporters in Russia were. seriously discussing how he deserved the Nobel peace prize. So what explains this sharp foreign policy shift? In a word:. Ukraine.

By the time it became clear this was wrong, a full-scale war was raging in two Ukrainian regions; a Malaysian Airlines plane had. been shot down over Ukraine. G8 had reverted to the G7. international sanctions lists. Finding himself in a Ukrainian dead end, Putin decided to raise the stakes. He acted to ensure the issue of Ukraine would seem insignificant and that. Russia. The protracted conflict inside Syria was a gift to Putin.. With Russia now a key player in Syria , the west is once again forced to negotiate with Moscow. Russian army attacks are now targeting not just Isis strongholds, but also pro-western opposition bases. The aim is to prolong the war, thereby ensuring Russia s place at the international negotiation table and legitimising the Kremlin s foreign policy. It s even more ironic, then, that Russia s military HQ in Syria is officially called. The Centre for Reconciliation. A classical music concert played among the ruins of Palmyra, destroyed by Isis in 2015, is a perfect symbol of Putin s politics in Syria. The headline performer of the night was cellist Sergey Roldugin, an old friend of Putin s,. who, according to evidence in the Panama Papers. Russians are convinced that Putin is fighting the Islamic State, thus preventing terrorist attacks at home. It is a PR coup in Russia and abroad and nothing will change until western leaders talk to Putin   not about Syria, but about Ukraine and sanctions.. . . More comment. Topics. . .

Gaim Kibreab, a professor of refugee studies at London South Bank University, says Eritrea is the world s  fastest emptying nation . About 400,000 people are estimated to have left the country in the past decade,. from a population of just 5.1 million. The UN and human rights activists estimate that as many as 5,000 Eritreans. flee illegally every month. Those left behind in Asmara say everyone is well aware of what is happening.

Last year, the government put a limit on the amount of money that people could withdraw from their bank accounts. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images. For law-abiding Eritreans, it is hard to avoid the national service programme. Hundreds of soldiers are known to storm neighbourhoods in Asmara every few months. Known as a. giffa. Young Eritreans. say they feel trapped. The government has recently changed some elements of national service, a sign that the regime may be aware of the damage its policies are causing. Those drafted in 2001 or earlier are being allowed to leave active service, but they are still required to work for the government. The maximum salary offered after demobilisation is 4,000 nakfa, equivalent to $165 on the black market, according to Hagos Ghebrehiwet, the PFDJ director of economic affairs.. Last year, the government put a limit on the amount of money that people could withdraw from their bank accounts, saying it wanted to encourage citizens to use cheques and mobile money facilities. Hagos said:  Cash is the basis for illegal activities, like human trafficking. . . . . . We would all leave tomorrow if we had the money. . Adonay. . . However, very few businesses accept cheques or credit cards, and since the introduction of the rule, the black market dollar. .  With this new currency, people don t have access to their money,  Demsas said. According to human rights activist Meron Estefanos, wealthy Eritreans can pay high-ranking government officials between $5,000 and $6,000 to be smuggled out of the country and driven to Khartoum in. Sudan. For most Eritreans, who do not have rich friends or relatives overseas, the journey to Europe is extremely expensive. Natnael Haile, who lives in Sweden, says he was drafted into the army aged 13. After spending seven years repairing army cars on a desolate military base, he crept out of his dormitory in 2008. Haile paid smugglers $400 to take him to Sudan, where he was kidnapped and sold to nomads in the Sinai desert.. Haile ended up paying a total of $7,100 to get on a boat heading for the Italian island of Lampedusa. But the account of his harrowing journey does not deter Adonay and his friends in Asmara.  We would all leave tomorrow if we had the money,  they say.. A version of this article first appeared. in The Africa Report. . . More features. Topics. . .

This detail was crucial for a simple reason: no president of the DRC since independence in 1960 had met a peaceful political end.. The DRC s first president, Joseph Kasavubu, was overthrown in 1965 by Joseph Mobutu, plunging the country. in chaos and a kleptocracy. In May 1997, Laurent-D sir  Kabila, backed by the armies of Rwanda and Uganda, overthrew Mobutu, sending him into exile in Morocco.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . .

Less than four years later, Kabila was murdered during an attempted coup, allegedly by. one of his bodyguards. after the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. Joseph Kabila, the current president, assumed power after his father s death. He had joined Laurent-D sir  Kabila s rebel group,. the AFDL. At first, it seemed as if Kabila was broadly supportive of democracy in his country. A year after he oversaw the signing of the constitution, 15 million Congolese. voted for a government for the first time in more than 40 years. Though it was far from a perfect or peaceful election, it was a landmark moment. Kabila was duly announced the winner with 58.05% of the vote, formally ending the so-called 1+4 transition period that brought the government and dozens of rebel leaders together in a loose coalition.. Five years later, in 2011, Kabila organised another election, which he won again,. but this time amid allegations of fraud. Fast-forward to the present and Kabila, who is constitutionally barred from running again, appears to have changed his mind about democracy.. He is refusing to hold an election and cede power,. attacking anyone who calls for him to stand down. continues to stand firm. One reason he will not go is that power is profitable. When Mobutu was overthrown, he had. amassed an estimated fortune of $5bn. alleged to have embezzled billions.

Peter Bunyan, 43, from Penzance in Cornwall, was convicted of raping and sexually assaulting the girls when they were aged between three and six. One of the girls remembers him wearing at least some of his police uniform when he attacked her..  Bunyan, an ex PCSO in Camborne and Redruth, was previously jailed for having sex while on duty and for using police computers to collect data about vulnerable women.. A jury at Truro crown court found Bunyan guilty on Monday of three counts of rape and one of sexual assault between 2005 and 2009. He was found not guilty of one charge of rape against one of the girls. Bunyan had denied the allegations.. The jury heard it was only when one of the girls had a police officer visit her school that her memory was triggered and she began to piece together what happened before confiding in family members and school staff.. Medical examinations carried out following the allegations suggested both the girls had suffered injuries that suggested they had been sexually abused.. Sentencing Bunyan, Judge Simon Carr said:  You assaulted them in a way that they would stay quiet .... Both of the victims have since spoken of the pain they were in during and after the ordeal..  Both of the girls are struggling to come to terms with what happened to them and the utter devastation caused by your actions. The victims have also since self-harmed as a way of coming to terms with it all. . An NSPCC spokesman said:  Bunyan is a sexual predator who is now thankfully behind bars. His appalling crimes robbed his defenceless victims of their childhood and could have a lasting impact well into their adult years..   No child should ever have to experience what the victims went through. It is vital anyone affected can get the support they need rather than suffer in silence, as sadly so many do. .  In 2013 at Taunton crown court, Bunyan was found guilty of misconduct in a public office.. He had neglected his duties by turning his police radio down on shifts before having sex with women and treated police computers  as a dating agency  by accessing using it to perform background checks on women.. . . . . . .

Guardian journalist Maeve Shearlaw under pressure as she s led through the intense interactive security training video for aid workers Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian. Budget constraints meant the video had to be filmed in the UK which means it lacks some of the authenticity of the Middle East. It does however capture all the glamour of a UK NGO headquarters: a dingy office, African wall hangings, people eating breakfast at their desk and shouty meetings which take place across dodgy Skype connections.. Most of the decisions are procedural which may leave someone not from the field wanting a bit more drama, but they are not the target audience   this is designed for those staff who deal with these realities everyday.. The training is available online and as a desktop app to cater for people living in areas with a poor internet connection, and is available in four languages: English, Arabic, French and Spanish. It s about a mindset shift, says Denman, explaining  staff are not just listening to HQ about what is dangerous and why, they are empowered in the decision making process. . The charity received a grant from the Department for International Development to cover the costs of making the videos and complementary resources, and while Denman admits it wasn t cheap they estimate it costs $450 to train one person compared to an average costs of $2,500 for a face-to-face training, which is often  not accessible to many people, especially national staff working in hostile environments. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As the world is bombarded with images of maimed civilians lying among rubble, an immersive experience could help people understand  what led up to those particular situations, and why people decided to remain. There is currently a lack of sympathy. People ask  why haven t they left  or  why haven t they done this or that ,  says Denman.. And while RedRUK are focused on providing security training Denman also believes that use of immersive video could also help improve the inclusion of marginalised groups in humanitarian response. If people could see how a decision impacted a disabled person, for example, we might start to plan how we cater for them better, she adds.. Guardian journalist Maeve Shearlaw s verdict on Mission Ready?.  The team at RedRUK say they have tried to remove as much jargon from the instructions as possible to make it easier for people around the world to understand, but for people not from the field words like  project implementation  and referring to Skype as a  tool  does make it feel like you are firmly planted in NGO land.. . Ten seconds feels like ample time to make decisions, but maybe that s because I m sat in an office in south London, not in a tense situation where everyone around you is making different demands on your time.. This isn t virtual reality so you don t actually feel like you are in the situation that is being depicted on screen, but again that isn t the point of the exercise.

A bid to give the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated on Monday at a global wildlife summit.. The EU played a pivotal role in blocking the proposal, which was fought over by rival groups of African nations..  But the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), meeting this week in Johannesburg, passed other new measures for elephants that conservationists say will add vital protection..  All 182 nations agreed for the first time that. legal ivory markets within nations must be closed. allow one-off sales of ivory stockpiles was killed.  More than 140,000 of Africa s savannah elephants were. killed for their ivory. wiping out almost a third of their population. . . . . Poaching drives huge 30% decline in Africa's savannah elephants. . . . . 
Read more. The acrimonious debate over elephant poaching has split African countries. Namibia,. South Africa.  However, a. group of 29 African nations. Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection   a Cites  appendix 1  listing   which bans all trade. But the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, are listed on  appendix 2 , a lower level of protection. On Monday a proposal to add the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and. Botswana. Critics said the proposal would do little to protect elephants as all international trade is already banned, but proponents argued it was a crucial signal to poachers and criminals of a global crackdown on the illegal ivory trade. Botswana has the world s largest elephant population, about a third of all elephants, and it is growing. But it broke ranks with Namibia, South Africa and. Zimbabwe. Tshekedi Khama, Botswana s minister of environment, said:  There is concerning evidence that elephant poaching is moving south. The criminal networks that facilitate much of this trade are highly organised and fluid, operating over several regions in the continent. Therefore no population should be considered secure. Put simply, a threat to elephants anywhere is a threat to elephants everywhere. .  The Cote D Ivoire delegate said it was absurd to have some elephants on appendix 1 and some on appendix 2:  An elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not on the other. Elephants do not have passports. . Lee White, the British-born director of Gabon s national parks and Cites delegate, said poachers were now shooting on sight at his rangers. The upgrading of all elephants to the highest protection would have sent  a signal that we will come down as hard on poaching as we do on the trafficking of drugs, arms and people ..  However, Namibia s delegate threatened to withdraw entirely from Cites protections for elephants if the all populations were upgraded the highest levels.  It is completely fallacious that legal ivory trade covers illegal trade,  he said, a statement flatly rejected by other nations.. South Africa s environment minister, Edna Molewa, said rural communities must benefit from elephants if they are to tolerate the damage caused to crops and the lives sometimes lost.  We dare not ignore their voices,  she said.  Trophy hunting is the best return on investment [in elephant protection] with the least impact. . The EU, which with 28 votes is a powerful force at Cites, also opposed the upgrade to appendix 1. It said that Cites rules meant the highest level protection is reserved for populations that are in steep decline, and that this did not apply to the elephants in. Namibia. Some scientific and conservation groups agreed with this, including WWF, Traffic and the Zoological Society of London, arguing the integrity of the Cites was at risk..  The EU delegate to Cites said:  The proposal does not meet the biological criteria. [But] this does not mean in any way we are not concerned about the decline of elephants across the continent.  Several nations said cutting the demand for ivory, through education, and better enforcement against poachers were key..  The issue was forced to a vote and was defeated, leaving the southern African elephants on appendix 2. Earlier on Monday, Namibia and Zimbabwe had attempted to legalise the trade in ivory from those countries..  Namibia said its elephant population had doubled to 20,000 in the last 15 years. Charles Jonga, from the Campfire Programme, a rural development group in Zimbabwe, told the Cites summit:  The people in my community say:  These elephants they eat our crops, they damage our houses, what benefit do we get?  If they get benefits, they will protect and not poach. .  But Patrick Omondi, Kenya s delegate, said:  Poaching levels and trafficking in ivory are at their highest peak. History has shown the ivory trade cannot be controlled. We are reaching a tipping point and need to give elephants time to recover. . Both Namibia s and Zimbabwe s proposals, supported by Japan but opposed by the EU and US, were soundly defeated. Observers believe Namibia, Zimbabwe and South. Africa. Many conservation groups wanted all elephants to get the highest protection, but Tom Milliken, an elephant expert from wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, said. :.

Billionaire Mark Cuban, who s a Clinton surrogate,. called into CNN.  I get offered all the time these tax opportunities and I don t take them... if Donald is taking tax shortcuts, maybe he bought an insurance policy as opposed to doing something in real estate and took a huge tax write off off that income. We don t know. And that s the inherent problem. There s no transparency and he s so ashamed of what he s done he s not willing to speak up and explain to us what happened,  said Cuban.. Is Trump a genius for not paying taxes? Cuban was asked. He replied:. . . . . No, if he was such a genius, and there s nobody who likes to brag about his genius more than. Donald Trump. Just a reminder of Cuban s stance on taxes, he penned. an op-ed for the Guardian back in 2011. . . . . Make a boatload of money. Pay your taxes. Lots of taxes. Hire people. Train people. Pay people.

That is why I intend to work as hard as I can to see that she is elected and Trump is defeated.. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we must not elect a president who wants to resurrect failed trickle-down economics. When the very rich are becoming much richer and there has been a ten-fold increase in the number of billionaires since the year 2000, it is economic insanity for Trump to propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. His plan to scrap the estate tax would provide a $53 billion tax break to the Walton family of Wal-Mart, the wealthiest family in America. Who else would benefit?

James Bruce, 20, and his brother Matthew, 19, were handed community corrections orders on Monday after the attack last year near a club in Prahran.. James was leaving a bar on Chapel Street when a man of African background walking past overheard him say  my nigger  and an argument ensued, the Melbourne magistrates court heard.. The man confronted James about his use of the word and then walked away from Chapel Street.. CCTV footage captured James, who had been out drinking to celebrate a new job, following the man towards a car park. He savagely punched and kicked his victim, as one of his brothers tried to stop him.. Matthew kicked the man once in the groin as he lay on the ground before he and his other brother pulled James off the victim. All three left the scene..  Footage of this event was sickening and disturbing,  said the magistrate, Carolene Gwynn.  The attack was cowardly. . James, who was 19 at the time, said he was singing a song and the word  nigger  was not in reference to the victim.. Police do not allege the June 2015 attack was racially motivated, and the victim doesn t say it was either.

The event seemed a  one-off  for the pair, who made full admissions to police, showed remorse and voluntarily took part in a youth alcohol program, Gwynn said. Both were assessed as being a low risk of reoffending, and neither has drug or alcohol issues.. James was handed a two-year CCO, which includes 400 hours of community work, supervision and assessment for offending programs. Matthew s 14-month CCO includes 200 hours of community work and similar conditions.. James s lawyer, Domenic Care, unsuccessfully asked the court to stop media showing images of his client..

The next day, it claimed that a drone from the US-led coalition capable of carrying out airstrikes was in the area during the attack, arguing that Washington was trying to distract attention from its attacks on Syrian troops and an alleged assault on Aleppo by.

Rather than moving from neighbouring countries including Australia, Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands   where people have lived for between 40,000 and 50,000 years   Vanuatu s original inhabitants came from much further north in Taiwan and the northern.

They travelled past places where people were already living, but when they got to. Vanuatu. . Vanuatu map.  Only some time later did they intermarry with Papuan peoples to produce the genetic mix we see today in Vanuatu, and indeed across the Pacific. . Details of the scientists  findings were published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Nature.. Dr Stuart Bedford, of ANU s college of Asia and the Pacific, said debates about the origins of Pacific islanders had raged for centuries, particularly about the Lapita people who first colonised islands stretching from Vanuatu to nearby. Tonga.  It demonstrates the enormous potential for these sorts of studies but these data have already provided an extremely important piece of the puzzle,  he said.. Ancient DNA of a sample from a Tongan cemetery confirmed that the same group of people became the first inhabitants of Tonga only slightly later..  This is the first genome-wide data on prehistoric humans from the hot tropics, and was made possible by improved methods for preparing skeletal remains,  said Dr Ron Pinhasi at University College Dublin, a senior author of the study.. A team led by researchers at Harvard Medical School, University College Dublin, and the Max Planck institute for the Science of Human History led the DNA analysis..

In a two-pronged assault, the militants have also stepped up their months-long offensive in Helmand in the south, seizing Nawa district on Sunday, according to officials, and inching closer than ever to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.. Residents in Kunduz said the Taliban were occupying private homes. Many families were attempting to flee, but most roads leading out of the city were blocked. One resident, Asrala, said. Taliban. The Taliban attacked Kunduz from four different directions early on Sunday and had on Monday made it within 500 metres of the main square, according to residents. Their attack mimicked. an assault in September 2015.  We are inside [the] governor s building and we can t go outside, there is fighting everywhere,  said an official from the provincial governor s office. The governor, Asadullah Amarkheil, told reporters he would brief them on the situation once his family had been removed from the town.. . Map. In the early afternoon on Monday, Afghan special forces arrived from Kabul to conduct clearing operations. Afghan forces also carried out airstrikes, including in Sedarak, close to the main hospital.. When the city was last under Taliban control,. a US airstrike hit a M decins Sans Fronti rs hospital. Following Sunday s attack, MSF evacuated its foreign staff, who had been based in Kunduz to look after what was left of the destroyed hospital, said a spokesman for the charity. It also cancelled a commemoration ceremony on the hospital grounds, which had been expected to draw as many as 1,000 guests.. The UN also airlifted at least one foreign staff member in the afternoon.. Last year, as Taliban fighters advanced through Kunduz, government forces fled in droves, rendering the city defenceless. However, this time, according to western security sources, local intelligence became aware hours before the attack that Taliban had infiltrated the city, which helped them resist the assault. But residents were still concerned..  Kunduz is about to fall,  sad Ghulam Rabbani Rabbani, a member of the provincial council.  Government forces are resisting but the Taliban are too many. Only international forces can defeat the attackers,  he said.. According to a spokesman for the US military, Brig Gen Charles Cleveland, foreign forces had not yet conducted airstrikes in Kunduz.. Also on Sunday, in the country s south, officials said the Taliban captured Nawa district close to Lashkar Gah. The militants entered the district police chief s compound with a bomb-laden Humvee, which then detonated. The police chief, Ahmad Shah Salim, and three police officers were killed, said Mohammad Karim Attal, the provincial council chief.. The provincial governor s office, however, insisted that the district centre in Nawa was still in government hands.

The attacks raise concerns about leadership and coordination problems in the ranks of the Afghan security forces, their ability to repel the Taliban without assistance from Nato and US troops, and the approximately 17,000 Afghan special forces who shuttle between frontlines to shore up defences.. The attack is part of the Taliban s stated goal of capturing a provincial capital before the end of the year. In addition to Helmand and Kunduz, the Taliban also recently came close to capturing Tarin Kot, the capital of Uruzgan..

The UK government has made crystal clear its commitment to resettle vulnerable children under the Immigration Act and ensure those with links to the UK are brought here using the Dublin regulation.

Thousands of people also protested on Saturday in front of the parliament in Warsaw.. Women. Poland already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in. Europe. But the new law would criminalise all terminations, with women punishable with up to five years in prison. Doctors found to have assisted with a termination would also be liable for prosecution and a prison term.. Critics say that even a woman who suffers a miscarriage could be under criminal suspicion, and that doctors might be put off conducting routine procedures on pregnant women for fear of being accused of facilitating a termination.. . . . . Women to go on strike in Poland in protest at planned abortion law. . . . . 
Read more. Although a ban has received public support from elements within the Catholic church and Poland s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), neither initiated the proposals. They were drafted by hardline conservative advocacy group Ordo Iuris and submitted by the Stop. Abortion. While it was difficult to gauge strike participation in small towns and rural areas, which tend to be more conservative, participation in the cities appeared to be significant.. A large crowd gathered in central Warsaw and people were also out on the streets in other cities. Coffee shops were filled with groups of women dressed head to toe in black.. Agnieszka Krysztopolska, a 34-year-old banker, was sitting with several friends who were all boycotting work.  I have two children and it s not like I am some kind of hardline feminist but I do not agree with somebody depriving me of the right to my own health or that of my children. I think this bill is just dangerous,  she said.. Nearby, 28-year-old Magdalena Gwozdz chatted with her 17-year-old sister, who was boycotting school.  This should be a woman s choice and abortion should be available in case of rape or a damaged foetus,  Gwozdz said.  This is. Europe. The private news broadcaster TVN24, with some of its own presenters in black, showed images of establishments joining the strike, including a restaurant in Wroc aw that closed to let female employees participate and a museum in Krakow where none of the women showed up to work.. In Cz stochowa, perhaps the most Catholic city in the overwhelmingly Catholic nation, the city hall reported that 60% of female workers had not turned up to work.. Pro-choice activists called for the strike, or  national absence campaign , after the Polish parliament voted on 23 September for Stop Abortion s proposals to be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. Women were encouraged to take a day off work and domestic tasks and gather for meetings or demonstrations, to donate blood or do charity work.. Many Polish women say they are sick of deals being cut over their fundamental reproductive and human rights, which they argue threaten both their safety and their dignity..  A lot of women and girls in this country have felt that they don t have any power, that they are not equal, that they don t have the right to an opinion,  said Magda Staroszczyk, a strike coordinator, over the weekend.  This is a chance for us to be seen, and to be heard. . Organisers cite an assault on women s reproductive rights that goes beyond Stop Abortion s proposed ban. A separate, PiS-sponsored bill restricting IVF, which would make it illegal to freeze embryos and allow women to fertilise only one embryo at a time, was also passed to the parliamentary committee stage in September.. Monday s protest was inspired by an. all-out strike more than 40 years ago by the women of Iceland. The intensity of the so-called  black protests  has proved tricky for PiS, which presents itself as the guardian of traditional values in a country beset by liberal notions of multiculturalism, relaxed social mores and restrictive political correctness, but which remains mindful of the risks of alienating mainstream public opinion.. The party s leader, Jaros aw Kaczy ski, has suggested that the government might accept a compromise whereby terminations carried out because of foetal abnormalities would be banned, but terminations of pregnancies as a result of rape or incest would still be permitted..

One of the many recordings of Kim Jong-il. Photograph: The Lovers and the Despot.  When I watch our films [...] they are all dogmatic. Why do our films always have the same ideological stories? Why are there so many crying scenes?  Kim is heard asking in the tapes recorded by the couple, who had got hold of a tape recorder in captivity and wanted to show they were being held against their will.. Kim is also heard berating the upper echelons of society, saying they are  stuck inside the fence [and that] they only see their own things and they are happy with it .. . . . . The Lovers and the Despot review   riveting study of Kim Jong-il's movie-loving madness. . . . .

His appeal to Shin and Choi to inject some creativity into North Korean film-making is in stark contrast with state propaganda from the time, which paints North Korea as a glorious socialist utopia.. And at one point he is heard praising the capitalist work ethic of the enemy:  Frankly speaking, the reason is that in the South, they work hard because they need to make money and feed themselves. It s the result of blood, sweat and tears. But here, people are simply happy and comfortable   no one whips them onwards. . Documentary makers Ross Adam and Rob Cannan spent hours trawling through the tapes, which also reveal that the trio s relationship was not as clear cut as that of a tyrannical captor and his submissive captives. From their very first meeting it is clear that is Kim setting the tone,  said Adam, but  at times it feels like they re getting on as friends. They have shared ambitions and an obsession with cinema. . At time Kim is also heard to be almost deferential towards the director,  not only because Shin was older but also because he admires him and was a great fan , Cannan adds.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

A still from The Lovers and the Despot film. Photograph: Soda Pictures. The celebrity couple slowly earned the dictator s trust and, managed to escape during a trip to Austria to promote North Korean films in 1986, taking their secret recordings with them.. Translating the hours of the micro-cassette tapes was no easy task, Cannan explained. The sound was muffled because Choi had hidden the recorder in her handbag, and Kim s accent was difficult to decipher.  He was hard to understand, very fast... he used a lot of older words, like an older version of Korean   we went through several stages of translation. . Intelligence. Shin had already smuggled some of the tapes out of the country in 1985. Despite being closely chaperoned during all foreign trips during his captivity, Shin was able to pass the recordings to a former friend and film critic during a chance meeting in Budapest. He also conveyed the message that he was being held against his will.. The recordings found their way to David Straub, who was monitoring North Korean intelligence for the US State Department at the time.  It was the first time anyone in the US government, as far as I know, had heard his [Kim s] voice, besides a couple of words during a public address,  he recalled.. The tapes were invaluable for intelligence, he added. They were  a chance to asses how logical he was, an insight into his temperament. Kim Jong-il was sane and rational in his own way. . After their release Shin and Choi were debriefed by the South Korean intelligence services, but to this day many doubt their version of events. The couple insist they were forced to pledge allegiance both publicly and privately to communism during captivity, but for many in the South any pledge of allegiance to the North is unforgivable.. However, the tapes offer new insight into the kidnapping, and reveal how they were briefed by Kim on how to behave when they were sent to film festivals overseas. Before a trip to Moscow in 1985Kim is heard to say:  Don t say you were forced to come here. Say you came willingly. You wanted to make films here because there s no freedom in the South. . Shin replies:  Look, I m the one sticking with you. I m not going anywhere until I ve finished my masterpieces. But you know that! . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. At one point the conversation turns to international film festivals.. Kim asks:  Why there isn t a single South Korean film at the Montreal film festival? Shin replies:  They didn t get through to the shortlist  I don t even want to watch them. They drive me crazy. They just copy Japanese films.  Choi adds:  Honey, you used to do the same thing. . Ultimately, the recordings reveal an insecure young leader, eager for artistic validation from Shin and deeply anxious about what the world thinks about North Korean films..  If we don t catch up in the next 10 years, then frankly speaking, our film industry will fall behind. We may become the last,  he says.. The Lovers and the Despot is on general release. . .

The leftist-led government said unaccompanied minors, the elderly and infirm would be among the first to be moved as concerns mounted over the future of a landmark EU-Turkey deal to stem migrant flows..  The situation on the islands is difficult and needs to be relieved,  deputy minister for European affairs Nikos Xydakis told the Guardian.  Accommodation on the mainland will be more suitable. We will start with transfers of those who are most vulnerable, always in the sphere of implementing and protecting the EU-Turkey agreement. . . . . . EU and Turkey restart talks over migrant pact. . . . . 
Read more. The operation, expected to be put into motion this week, came as Ankara warned the pact would not hold if Brussels failed to honour its pledge to allow Turks visa-free travel to the bloc.. In a fiery speech before the newly reconvened parliament at the weekend, Turkish president. Recep Tayyip Erdo an.  This stance is a declaration that the European Union does not wish to keep the promise it made to. Turkey. Refugee flows, although rising again, have dropped by 90% since the deal was signed. At the height of the crisis, more than 7,000 men, women and children made the perilous sea crossing from. Turkey. Racheting up the pressure, Erdo an said the EU had to decide, once and for all, if it wanted to act on Turkey s decades-long bid to become a member.  If the EU is going to make Turkey a full member, we are ready. But they should know we have come to the end of the game. There is no need to beat around the bush or engage in diplomatic acrobatics. . Western diplomats in the Greek capital raised the spectre of chaos if the agreement collapsed.  If it does, there will be an influx of a million or more and this country is totally unprepared,  one European ambassador confided.  Athens will be overwhelmed, [as will] the mainland, people will be forced to live in fields, there will be scenes we ll never have imagined. . More than 60,000 refugees and migrants are in. Greece. Recently more than 4,000 people at the Moria camp in Lesbos   the island that has borne the brunt of the inflows   were evacuated after. frustrated inmates set fire to the vastly overcrowded facility.  There are rats, insects and reptiles including snakes everywhere in the camp,  they wrote adding that in the winter many fell ill to pneumonia and in the summer heat exhaustion.  Unclean water has caused diarrhoea and nausea. The longer we stay here, the worse conditions have got, and now most people are suffering from mental illnesses, depression and other diseases. . About 14,000 refugees are now trapped on Greek islands with Turkish coastguard data showing the number of migrants caught trying to make the sea crossing more than doubling in September.. Acknowledging that camp conditions were far from ideal, Xydakis blamed the backlog in asylum applications on the EU s failure to dispatch promised staff and push ahead with an agreed relocation scheme to other parts of the continent..  We were promised 400 experts in asylum procedures but so far only have around 29 on the islands. We are continuing to recruit and look for more staff but it is not easy,  he said.  The deal is not only in the hands of Turkey but. Europe. In the three months since Britain voted to leave the EU, the bloc had become ever more fractious, with central European and Balkan members increasingly pursuing their own agenda.  In the post-Brexit debate of how Europe will work,  flexible solidarity  has become the new key phrase,  he said.  If, in so many EU summits it has been agreed that the refugee crisis is a European problem then the solution to resolve it should be collective   allowing Greece to become [a holding pen for refugees] is absolutely unacceptable. . . .

Betty Nyaghoa sees something of herself when she looks at pupils in her charge at Gatoto primary school in the heart of one of Nairobi s grittiest shantytowns.. Like many of the children, she grew up in poverty, the youngest of 10 siblings, born to peasant farmer parents whose struggle to pay school fees left her in constant danger of being kicked out.. Now she runs the Gatoto ( small child  in Kiswahili slang) school in the Mukuru kwa Reuben slums in eastern Nairobi. The school was started by local people in 1994 when they saw the state was not going to provide all local children with an education.. . . . .

The elders felt something needed to be done to secure the future of the children who were not going to school and were spending their days collecting scrap metal for sale to the industries near this area,  says Nyaghoa.. Gatoto started with 370 pupils but now has 1,030 on the roll and is the soul of the community.. Before joining the school as its inaugural head, Nyaghoa had been running a thriving business selling maize and beans. She had been a teacher earlier in life, but was made redundant by the government.  I was passionate about education from a young age. I really admired teachers. The way they spoke, the way they dressed, I liked everything about them. . When she returned to teaching, she took a significant pay cut, with a starting salary at Gatoto of $10 a month. She found the going very tough in the first few years.. The school was ranked last in a divisional exam sat across the largest district in eastern Nairobi and, during an end-of-year meeting of headteachers, she was asked to explain Gatoto s miserable performance.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Betty Nyaghoa in her office at Gatoto school. Photograph: Murithi Mutiga.  I was tongue-tied, perhaps due to my lack of experience. I just asked the head of education in the area to come to the school and witness for himself the conditions in which we were working. . The education chief joined the tour and was shocked by what he found   almost 400 pupils were crammed into a single church building. Classes occupied different corners , with teachers competing with noise from the other five classes. There were no desks: students sat on benches in rows and wrote notes on their laps so they didn t take up too much space.  He could not believe his eyes,  she says.. The education chief prevailed on the city government authorities to allocate Gatoto a bigger parcel of land, although the community still had to pool resources to build rudimentary classrooms from iron sheets and timber.. The most devastating problem Nyaghoa faced, though, was at home. Her husband, also a teacher, felt threatened by her status as headteacher and became violent towards her.  Sometimes I would turn up with a swollen eye and explain to the kids that I banged my face on a door and one of them would say,  teacher, my mum was beaten by my dad and her eye was swollen just like that.  . She says:  I wanted my children to grow up in a stable, two-parent family. But I also wanted dignity. I chose to walk away. I lost my marriage but I have been able to give much more to the community. . Gatoto, which is supported by a number of donors including the Iris O Brien Foundation, American Friends of Gatoto, The Good Cause and Ireland s. SUAS educational development.  also offers needs-based scholarships to about 150 of its former students in high school and runs a feeding programme for 60 families affected by HIV.. . . . . Some of our parents could not afford the $2 fee per term, but we were taken in anyway. . . The school places great stock in extracurricular activities and its. choir. Like a proud mother, Nyaghoa reels off the names of the pupils who have gone from the slum to successful careers, including a biochemical engineer, a lecturer, a manager at Kenya s capital markets authority, and a recent student now studying to be a doctor. Regular talks by alumni are arranged to encourage the students.. Several of the school s 26 teachers are former pupils.  This school was a home away from home for us as children,  says one of the teachers, Geoffrey Kweya, 25.  It was everything. We could escape our problems to come and find peace here. .  Gatoto changed my life,  says another teacher, Esther Oywaya.  Some of our parents could not even afford the $2 fee for food or uniform per term but we were taken in anyway. We just encourage the pupils that they can achieve anything they want despite their circumstances here. . .

Drug dealers have previously urged him to forget the need for philanthropic funding support, promising him $100,000 a year to allow a dope plantation on the remote property instead, he says.. Some who  think I m a senile old idiot giving his house and property away  eye the house and not the animals, he says, figuring that having a dog or cat qualifies them to care for birds of prey and marsupials. Others see the size of his avian enclosures and propose turning the sanctuary into a zoo..  I ve had a few offers but I said no, I want this continuing as a wildlife hospital because that s what I ve tried to do for almost 30 years now,  Kunz says.  I don t want to lose what I created and built up, every shred, with all my money. . The hospital was inspired by Kunz s early experiences on his arrival in Sydney in 1982 seeing injured native birds such as galahs and cockatoos put down by Australian vets..  I got a shock because, where I come from in Austria, a sulphur-crested cockatoo was $3,000 in a pet shop. I didn t know you could buy them here for $10,  he says..

Like the EU referendum in Britain, it was a risk that Santos was not obliged to take: a yes/no vote over a complicated deal which had strong international support but tapped into and stirred a visceral resentment among many ordinary voters against the Farc. The difference is that this vote aimed to stop a war.. The result stunned the government, the Farc, analysts and even some no supporters.  This is a reality check,  said Kristian Herbolzheimer , a conflict resolution expert with Conciliation Resources, a UK-based peace consultancy.. Seeking to assuage fears of a return to war, both government and Farc quickly said that despite the setback they would insist on peace. Santos said a bilateral ceasefire in effect for just over a month would continue while the Farc said they would use their words as their weapons.. . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . .

It won t just be a dialogue between the government and Farc anymore,  he said.  They will have to look for creative solutions that could turn them into multi-party talks. . Santos has called for a dialogue with all political factions, including the no campaign led by his fiercest critic, former president Alvaro Uribe. Although Santos was Uribe s defence minister the two have become bitter enemies after Santos, following his election as president, did not continue Uribe s hardline policies against the Farc, instead sitting down to negotiations with the rebels.. The deal they came up with included provisions for the Farc to sever their ties to the drug trade, lay down their weapons and transition into a political movement. While rank and file fighters would have been granted amnesty, leaders would face a special tribunal where, if they confessed, they would have been sentenced to punishments stopping short of imprisonment.. Uribe said that the deal reached with the Farc granted impunity to leaders responsible for serious crimes, rewarded criminals by allowing them to participate in politics and eroded Colombia s constitution and institutions.. But whether a new deal can be made is unclear.  The burden now will be on Uribe to prove that he can come up with a better plan,  Herbolzheimer said.  It s difficult to say what is possible and what is not. . Analyst Hector Riveros said a direct meeting between Uribe and Farc leader Timochenko may happen soon, although Uribe rejected a Farc invitation in May to talks in Havana.. . . . .

He also warned that while the Farc have maintained strict command over their troops, the results of the vote may begin to show fissures in the guerrillas  resolve for peace. Even before the plebiscite, renegade members of one rebel unit had said they would not join the peace deal..  Now the Farc are completely vulnerable and open to profound divisions,  Giraldo said.  They are going to be afraid that this could all fall apart at any moment. . Despite the outcome, Herbolzheimer said he doesn t think it was a mistake to put the deal to a popular vote.  It they hadn t had the plebiscite those opposed would have, for the rest of history, blamed Santos for everything that might have gone wrong. .

Several rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have reported that up to 400 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters, the country s worst unrest in more than a decade.. The deaths on Sunday occurred in the town of Bishoftu, about 25 miles (40km) south of Addis Ababa. Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered at a sacred lake for the annual Irreecha festival of thanksgiving. Crowds chanting  we need freedom  and  we need justice  prevented community elders, seen as close to the government, from delivering speeches.. Some protesters reportedly waved the red, green and yellow flag of the Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group branded a terrorist organisation by the government. According to witnesses, protesters threw stones and bottles and security forces responded with baton charges and then teargas grenades.. The teargas caused panic and at least 50 people fell on top of each other into a deep ditch. Images from the scene showed dozens of men trying to climb out of a trench that appeared to be at least 6 metres (20ft) deep.. Witnesses said they saw people dragging out a dozen or more victims showing no obvious sign of life. Half a dozen people were seen being taken by pickup truck to a hospital, one witness said..

Read more. The quip is a reminder that while this weekend s referendum in Hungary was born from similar frustrations to the Brexit vote in June, the Hungarian right does not want to leave the EU. Instead it wants something that is perhaps even more of a threat to the EU s future: it wants to stay part of the union   and subvert it from the inside. Viktor Orb n, Hungary s nationalist prime minister, seeks what he calls a counter-cultural revolution within the EU  . greater autonomy for nation states and less emphasis on liberal and humanitarian principles. While. Hungary. But analysts noted that he had ultimately failed to encourage a majority of his own population to vote against refugees and against a more humanitarian vision of the EU. As a result, this failure has arguably given some unexpected breathing space to the European politicians whose ideas Orb n so strongly opposes   notably Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission..  This will be viewed as a relief in Brussels,  said Andr s B r -Nagy, a former EU official and the head of research at Policy Solutions, a Budapest-based thinktank.  It s clearly a disappointing result for Orb n and I think his European ambitions will suffer as a result.

Colombians look likely to back a peace accord with Marxist rebels in a referendum on Sunday, the final hurdle for a deal that would end 52 years of war and allow. Farc. The plebiscite asks for a simple  yes  or  no  on whether Colombians support the accord signed on Monday by President Juan Manuel Santos, who has staked his legacy on peace, and the rebel commander known as Timochenko..

Read more. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of. Colombia. Polls taken before Sunday s referendum show.  the  yes  vote favored. The influential former president Alvaro Uribe has led the  no  camp, arguing that rebels should pay for crimes in jail and never be given congressional seats. But most Colombians, including some who see the accord as too soft on Farc, seem convinced that an imperfect peace is better than more war..  This country needs a change and it has to be today,  Fabiel Cruz, 31, an administrator, said after voting  yes .  It s the only chance we have. If it s not today it will be never. . Under the accord, Farc, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, can compete in the 2018 presidential and legislative elections and will have 10 unelected congressional seats guaranteed through 2026.. Farc s Marxist rhetoric goes very much against the beliefs of the largely conservative Colombian population and most, including Santos, think the group will have difficulty finding a political footing..  I voted no. I don t want to teach my children that everything can be forgiven,  said Alejandro Jaramillo, 35, angered that the rebels will not serve jail time.. Javier Milanes, 34, a restaurant owner who also voted no, said:  The accord gives a lot of concessions to the guerrillas. They changed their strategy from arms to politics but the goal is still socialism. .

If the peace accord is approved on Sunday, Santos will probably turn his focus towards a much-needed tax reform and other measures to compensate for a drop in oil income, as well as possible talks with the smaller ELN rebel group.. For the referendum to be ratified, at least 13% of the electorate, or 4.5 million voters, must cast  yes  ballots. Turnout is expected to be low, no higher than the 40% seen in recent congressional elections, a sign to some analysts that Colombians  enthusiasm for the ambitious accord is lacking.. Also potentially affecting turnout, especially along the Caribbean coast, is heavy rainfall left by. Hurricane Matthew.  We in Colombia have to adopt this culture of non-violence,  Santos said shortly after casting his ballot in a washed-out Plaza Bolivar next to the presidential palace.  All of us can be protagonists in this historic change taking place in our nation. . Farc leaders in recent days have made an effort to show their commitment to peace is real. Twice this week, leaders travelled to areas hard hit by the violence to apologize for massacres committed by their troops and discuss compensation..  All of us in life have committed mistakes, some with consequences more serious than others,  Farc leader Ivan Marquez said Friday at a ceremony in a northern Colombian town, where rebels in 1994 disrupted a street party with gunfire, killing 35..  There s nothing to lose in recognizing it. Speaking the pure and clean truth heals the soul s wounds, no matter how deep they are. . On Saturday, in the presence of United Nations observers, Farc voluntarily destroyed 620kg of grenades and light explosives. It also said it would compensate victims with financial resources and land holdings accumulated during the war.. If the accord is ratified, Farc s roughly 7,000 fighters will move to 27 concentration zones where over six months they will gradually turn over their weapons to UN observers and prepare for their reintegration into civilian life.. . .

At this time of day, there are two nearby bars he could have been hanging out at instead   shabby-chic fascimiles of industrial-town dives, except for the $8 beers   but he and his husband won t go in them. In fact, he has already told one of the bar owners that he s planning a protest with his neighbours against them.. Like the rest of the tenant union organisers, Gir n volunteers his time to help this three-year-old group fight to keep long-time tenants in their homes. It s a deceptively simple assignment   but here, in Crown Heights, it might just be the key to stopping yet another episode in New York s ongoing history of social cleansing..  All the other organising strategies have been tried in Bushwick,  Gir n says.  They basically pit the landlord against the tenant against the quote-unquote gentrifiers. And when you do that, you re not going to win anything. . Indeed, in the great war against gentrification throughout. New York. Next in the crosshairs is Crown Heights, which used to be almost exclusively peopled by African Americans and Hasidic Jews. It is now the last line of defence for  affordable  Brooklyn, where,. according to a new report. A quarter of a century ago in 1991, this neighbourhood was the. the site of riots. both communities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

The story is the same as it was in Bushwick or Bed-Stuy: as renters get priced out of the rest of New York, many landlords in Crown Heights are trying to chase out long-time and rent-stabilised tenants, so they can charge more to new renters or sell buildings to developers; the developers, meanwhile, are building more luxury units in the neighbourhood.. The losers? Residential tenants who can t afford the new normal, and small neighbourhood businesses.. The CHTU has seen it happen elsewhere in Brooklyn, and is determined Crown Heights won t end up like the rest. The organisation fights on several levels: it looks to rack up wins for residents through individual tenant assistance, lobbying in Albany for better state laws, and direct action   such as when, on the coldest day of the winter, tenants in one building. found themselves without any heat.  We rushed the lobby and we sat there until the heat came on,  Gir n recalls   and that only happened when the union called local media.  It was the first time I realised the immediacy of having not just an organisation that s in the neighborhood, but actual neighbours. . The CHTU approach is straightforward.  We have to disrupt the landlords  business model by helping tenants remain in their apartments,  Gir n says. There are two keys: building community, then educating tenants about their rights and how to enforce them.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
A defaced poster showing an impending Crown Heights development. Twice a week, Gir n accompanies tenants to housing court, to prevent intimidation and show landlords the CHTU is firmly on the tenants  side. He also helps tenants figure out who actually owns their buildings: some landlords attempt to obscure their involvement to avoid bad publicity about their tactics or housing conditions.. What Crown Heights has learned from other neighbourhoods is that while big fights might seem unwinnable, small victories can lead to bigger ones. For example, one hold-out tenant can be enough to prevent a developer from buying a building; keeping tenants in place can disrupt the whole cycle of gentrification.. One example of this is sitting across the table from us: Marcia Louisy. Gir n says:  The only way to put a pause on this [gentrification] is when the Marcias of the world hold it down. . Louisy is a transplant from Jamaica. Eighteen years ago, she moved into a rent-controlled, three-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights. She pays roughly $1,000 a month; the neighbours upstairs pay $4,500. Her apartment could clearly fetch thousands more on the open market, and her landlord has already offered her $250,000 to move.. That sounds like a lot of money, but it would be. subject to significant taxes. According to Gir n, many tenants in the area are harassed and intimidated into taking buyouts, or driven out by crumbling apartments and a lack of repairs. The goal is the same: get rid of rent-controlled tenants with, in many cases, generational rights to remain.. Total disrespect. Vaughn Armour, a 17-year resident of Crown Heights, is also facing down a landlord trying to buy him out. His long-time girlfriend, Barbara Simmons, who lived in the same apartment for 42 years, passed away over Labor Day weekend. Before her memorial service, the landlord went to the apartment to encourage Armour and Simmons  son to leave..  She s not even buried yet, and [the landlord] had the audacity to offer my stepson $5,000 for the apartment,  Armour says.  That is total disrespect..  He don t realise that I m a member of New York.

We need to get out and start talking to tenants in the buildings, and tell them:  As long as you re paying your rent and you re not destroying their property or being a nuisance to other neighbours, you shouldn t be harassed,   he says.  It works, too. . Helping renters stay in their homes, though, is only half the gentrification fight. Developers are also tearing down old buildings to erect luxury apartments that few locals could afford, in a city where rents have risen twice as fast as incomes.. As Armour puts it:  Developers shouldn t be able to come in and build something that no one who lives here can afford. . New buildings in neighbourhoods like Crown Heights must usually set aside a certain number of  affordable  units, although many people can t afford even those.  Especially around this area   Lefferts, Albany, Kingston   the average salary per year is $23,000,  says Armour, adding that the  affordable housing  in some of the new apartment buildings doesn t reflect that.

There is little solidarity among the 100 residents of the burned-out building where Phololo, 58, has lived unlawfully for nearly 20 years. Each races to the shattered bottles left on the pavements outside the bars and restaurants. Sold by the kilo for recycling, the glass provides the residents with enough money to eat..   It s not easy at my age, but it s all I ve got,  Phololo says..  By dawn, the residents of 54 Soper Road are back home. They rest in overcrowded, windowless rooms or on the verandah, enjoying the few rays of sun that pierce the wall of tower blocks surrounding their small, derelict building. There is no gas, electricity or sanitation. Water comes from a single standpipe. Children play in the rubbish-strewn yard..  Nothing really has changed here for years,  says Mandla Kayise, 50, who moved into the squat a decade ago when he arrived jobless in Johannesburg from his poor village in KwaZulu-Natal, 350 miles south.. But soon he, Phololo and the others will be gone. An eviction is scheduled later this year. Despite the length of time many have been living there, no law in.

Once infamous for violence, crime and so-called.  hijacked  buildings. But the change, though real, is limited   and exactly how widely its benefits will be shared is not yet clear..   Regeneration has to be for everyone   I have no problem with land for luxury apartments, as long as there is commensurate land for the poor,  says Stuart Wilson, of the local NGO. Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa. Many have dated the decline of the 18 sq km inner city of Johannesburg to the country s first democratic elections in 1994, which saw the African National Congress (ANC) take power..  But this is unfair, says Gerald Garner, a local historian and guide. Racist measures adopted by the apartheid regime from the 1950s gradually forced industries out of Johannesburg s centre in search of labour. Then international sanctions led to the exodus of global companies and their staff in the mid 1980s..  The cumulative effect was devastating, according to Garner. Apartment blocks and homes emptied, the doors of multi-storey offices were locked, luxury hotels closed. Basic utilities were disconnected.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . .

When racist laws restricting movement were reluctantly eased by the beleaguered apartheid regime, tens of thousands of poor migrants rushed to the city. Others came, and still come, from elsewhere in. Africa. Fitful regeneration efforts began around 15 years ago with major public projects funded by the ANC-run town hall, central government and overseas aid. Momentum gathered as South Africa prepared to host the 2010 World Cup, and private developers began buying up the  hijacked  buildings, evicting squatters and constructing apartments.. Sometimes this occurred peacefully, but in the past the process of emptying occupied buildings has, on occasion, involved significant violence. This was directed both at South African citizens, some of them long-term residents, and the large numbers of migrants who continued to flow in from poorer, less stable neighbouring countries and beyond.. Now only 100 or so illegally occupied buildings remain, though these still provide accommodation for about 60,000 people.. The residents of 54 Soper Road, in the tough neighbourhood of Berea, are among them. Berea has proved resistant to regeneration. There are many illegally occupied buildings and few of the signs of economic growth seen elsewhere. Pawnshops, nail parlours and liquor stores line dirty streets. Violent crime and prostitution is rife..  The washing gets stolen before it dries,  says Majozi Thembezile, 57.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

For the last three years the residents have faced eviction but, despite the appalling conditions, they do not want to leave.  We have very little hope from our side,  says Thembezile, who like many residents at 54 Soper Road came to Johannesburg from a rural village 20 years ago.. A last-ditch legal battle may delay the eviction, but is unlikely to halt it.. The fate of Thembezile s home raises important questions about the future regeneration of Johannesburg, and has implications across South Africa and beyond. One is how to find alternative accommodation for thousands of very poor people living in neighbourhoods that are now being gentrified.. Current provision is grossly inadequate. Since a landmark court ruling in 2011, the local council is obliged by law to house anyone evicted to make room for either private or public developments. Campaigners and experts, however, say authorities have provided only a handful of squalid and overcrowded blocks where families are forcibly split up. Even these can only meet a fraction of the demand.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

As a result, the development of the city centre is forcing the very poor living there, who are almost all black,. . townships.  Some say the new exodus recalls that darker, earlier period:  We are replicating the apartheid city. Obviously there is no racial segregation any more   but we are entrenching historical inequality,  says Wilson.. Eviction would mean ruin for the residents of 54 Soper Road. They say the city council has told them there is no money to rehouse them locally, when most make a living within walking distance of their home as security guards, day labourers or recyclers. Commuting from rented accommodation further out, even if they could find something affordable, would be prohibitively expensive.. Much depends on the city s. new mayor, Herman Mashaba.  Mashaba took office just weeks ago, ending decades of ANC civic rule. In an interview with the Guardian, he said living conditions at places such as 54 Soper Road amounted to human rights abuses and that the city had  a responsibility to help the destitute .. It is unclear, however, whether local authorities can find the funds, administrative capacity and, most importantly, the political will to adequately rehouse those rendered homeless by development.. Mashaba certainly has an uncompromising message for those who are trying to halt the evictions, and a welcoming one for investors.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . .

That city is Vancouver, and in response to these mounting challenges, the west-coast Canadian metropolis recently imposed an. extraordinary new tax on foreign buyers. On 2 August, Vancouver introduced a tax on anyone from outside. Canada. The impact has, by some measures, been more startling than campaigners could have hoped for. The price of the average detached home. reportedly slumped. British Columbia s premier, Christy Clark, who introduced the tax,. told reporters. In the year before the tax, prices in the city were galloping ahead at a rate of 39% a year amid widespread concern that investors, from China in particular, were. pricing out local residents. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Vancouver authorities have taken extraordinary action to curb its super-heated housing market. Photograph: Alamy. It is a concern echoed in cities across the Pacific Rim. In June, Sydney introduced a 4% stamp duty surcharge on foreigners buying homes; the following month, Melbourne hiked stamp duty rates from 3% to 7% for foreign buyers   in both cases to deter rampant property speculation.. Queensland, whose capital is Brisbane, has followed suit with an extra 3% duty surcharge that will be slapped on  foreign persons  buying residential property and land from 1 October.

Read more. Global property agents Knight Frank say there has been a big increase in cities and countries   from Switzerland to Fiji   imposing measures to deter foreign buyers in recent years. However China, traditionally one of the countries most resistant to such investment,. eased its rules in 2015. How long-lasting the impact of Vancouver s tax will prove is a subject of much debate. Greater Vancouver s Real Estate Board prefers to use measures that suggest the city s market has only dipped mildly.. And earlier this month Jing Li, a 29-year-old Chinese student living in the adjoining city of Burnaby,. began a class-action lawsuit. According to CBC News, this added C$84,000 to the price of Li s house, meaning she was suddenly at risk of losing her C$56,000 deposit.  I can t go forward and I can t go back,  she told CBC..  The only solution . Ron Jordens, a 72-year-old retired engineer, lives in a rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant: once a gritty working-class Vancouver neighbourhood, now hipster central.. The block s landlords have served an eviction notice. According to Jordens, they are hoping to cash in on the boom by renovating the flats   and raising rents by 50%.. He says the  renovation  is unnecessary.  People who have a good, decent-paying job can t afford to buy in Vancouver, and they can barely afford to rent,  Jordens says.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. . Ron Jordens is facing eviction. The new tax, he adds, is just  putting a Band-Aid  on the problem, predicting that  there will be ways around it with side-contracts. It has got to the point where the only solution has to be a  no foreign ownership  deal on the table. . But isn t Canada a country built on immigration? Jordens points to the thousands of unoccupied flats across the city, built for investors who often never reside there.  If you are coming to live here, get a job and pay taxes, that s great. The trouble is they don t live here, and they don t pay taxes. . There are an estimated 10,000-plus empty apartments in Vancouver, of which a significant number are owned by foreign investors. In mid-September, 200 protestors from a new campaign group,. HALT. academics who argue that the Canadian home-owning dream is being crushed. . Vancouver tops UBS's Global Real Estate Bubble Index. The protests appear to be working: an empty homes tax last week won the approval of city councillors and is set to be implemented next year. Even owners of empty Airbnb flats could be fined $10,000 for failing to comply. Vancouver is fast turning into a test-bed of initiatives to cool outrageous property prices and rents.. But over on West Vancouver s Marine Drive, home to plush waterfront estates (one sold for $50m last year), the city s biggest realtor to Chinese investors, Clarence Debelle, says the new taxes are  driven by jealousy and envy .. He says the Vancouver market was slowing in any case, and that the 15% tax on overseas buyers will do nothing to help priced-out 25- to 35-year-olds buying entry-level apartments. But it could, he warns, destroy the local economy..  Virtually everything being built in West Vancouver is being built for a Chinese buyer. Vancouver has no industry apart from tourism and construction. So what do we do? Decide to insult the Chinese. You may not just blight the property market, but bankrupt the construction industry, too. . Debelle predicts stalemate in Vancouver s market as sellers refuse to drop prices. And he fears for Canada s global reputation:  In my view, the Chinese see this as a racist-motivated tax. It s a dark moment in Canadian political history..  It s the wrong tax too,  he adds,  as it won t help the people at the bottom wanting to get into the market. It has not changed the pricing of their homes one bit. There are better ways to help, such as increasing supply. . Debelle s own father emigrated from Europe after the second world war.  Vancouver is now an international destination. You can t have it both ways: benefit from trade and tourism,. and.  The market has been distorted . Vancouver s experiment is being closely watched in London. According to London Assembly member. Sian Berry. . . . . Vancouver shows that the rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is a growing problem worldwide. . Sian Berry. . .  London needs more devolution so we can take similar steps,  Berry says,  controlling stamp duty and council tax, and closing the loopholes that allow people to buy property through offshore companies   so that the people who actually live in London can stand a chance..   A huge amount of housing in London is being bought up by offshore companies to avoid paying tax,  she adds.  In my area in north London, overseas companies bought up  2.5bn of property in just four years and avoided hundreds of millions in stamp duty. . Berry s concerns are shared not only by the left. The Bow Group, a conservative thinktank,. issued a paper last year. The report s author, Daniel Valentine, traces the. phenomenal increase in London house prices. These factors have, he says, corrupted the market, creating an insatiable  investment demand  divorced from the underlying needs of British society.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney s Eastwood suburb. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images. On the other side of the Pacific to Vancouver, the same arguments are rehearsed in Australia and New Zealand, although not just about the global elite. One. recent report. Two decades ago, buying a house in a major Australian city cost around five times the income of the average young Australian. Now, after the country s economic boom, it is about 15 times.. Pete Wargent is a leading property buying agent in Sydney and Brisbane.  The phenomenon of the Chinese buyer has been a huge story here for years now. But you just have to look where Australia is; there are a lot of pathways for Chinese money. . He says the flood of Chinese cash has sparked an. extraordinary building boom. Given that Australia bans foreign buyers of existing homes, nearly all the Chinese money is pouring into new-build towers. The 4% stamp duty surcharge means a non-resident buyer pays about A$30,000 more than an Australian resident for a A$750,000 apartment in Sydney.. . . . . Gentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution. . . . . 
Read more. It s difficult to assess the impact of the surcharge yet, says Wargent, although he notes a gathering panic in some Australian banks, which are now far less keen to lend to non-residents. From 2017 a second new surcharge will hit non-residents: a 0.75% land tax, which has to be paid each year. Some fear that apartments bought off-plan will be dumped back on the market en masse.. Will that help to moderate prices for local buyers?  Eventually it could help,  says Wargent.  The problem in Sydney and Melbourne is that the market has been heavily distorted in favour of investors. In Sydney more than half the market is investors, which is a crazy imbalance. .. Critics say that a flood of apartment purchases through domestic pension  super-funds  is more to blame for the spiralling prices than Chinese buyers. Wargent also throws into the mix  landbanking  by major developers   drip-feeding sites into the market to ensure prices keep soaring   plus loose lending criteria from the major banks..  In truth, it has been tough for first-time buyers for nearly a generation now,  he says.

Is it a purely economic process, or is it culturally driven? Is every deprived neighbourhood that experiences an influx of wealthy residents an instance of gentrification? Must the change occur organically, or can governments gentrify areas according to a plan?. In the half-century since Ruth Glass first employed the term   to describe the return of the London middle classes to Victorian properties previously subdivided into slums   sociologists, geographers, economists and anthropologists have all struggled to agree on a coherent and transferable definition of the politically loaded G-word..  In recent years, however, increasing amounts of data and the ability to overlay divergent phenomena has led to studies that try to make sense of what is sometimes described as a  phantom concept . By understanding and measuring the process, some believe it may be possible to alleviate the most damaging effects of gentrification: the impoverishment and displacement that frequently accompany it.. The most fundamental evidence for gentrification comes from the cost of property. Rapid increases in the cost of buying or renting a house, above rises in income, are clear signs of a rapid change in the urban character of a neighbourhood.. Last year, NYU s Furman Center prepared. a report on New York City. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
Activists in the Brooklyn neighbourhoods of Bushwick created an interactive mapping resource to track gentrification. Graphic by. Bushwick Community Map project. While rents increased generally over this 20-year period, various neighbourhoods, such as the infamous Williamsburg   spiritual home of the hipster   saw increases as much as 50% higher than those of the city as a whole. These changes corresponded to generally perceived changes in demographics and social class.. The Voorhees Center at the University of Illinois called its study of Chicago over 40 years a  . gentrification index. The results, too, tallied with anecdotal evidence. Chicago s central lakeside areas, which had seen postwar decline with American suburbanisation, have become highly desirable again; they have significantly gentrified. But the data also shows that these upwardly mobile neighbourhoods are surrounded by many suburbs that have declined severely over the same time.. While census data is rich and comprehensive, there are concerns that the relatively sporadic collection of information just doesn t have the fine resolution required to identify gentrification in some of its wilder forms, where neighbourhoods are transformed within a matter of years. If the phenomenon is to be spotted in time to help those who suffer from it, we need to be better at predicting it.. In these cases, the challenge is to identify the preconditions for gentrification. The classic analysis is to find the  rent gap , as developed by geographer Neil Smith: a period of decline in which the. potential. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . .

But it s also due to the strength of its communicative power. For example, the recent deprivation maps of. England. Scotland. ,. Joseph Rowntree Foundation. . Some studies aim to be tools for residents to stay one step ahead. Activists in Bushwick, one of Brooklyn s rapidly changing neighbourhoods, have created. an interactive mapping resource.  Data graphics can even be a polemic. When the Heygate, a 1970s council estate in London, was controversially demolished to make way for new and mostly private developments, the campaign group Heygate Was Home used freedom of information requests to graphically map out the. displacement. original residents. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Mapping gentrification in Nottingham. Graphic by. Alasdair Rae/Joseph Rowntree Foundation. One of the problems with measuring gentrification, of course, is that not every variable always appears in the same way. For example, the particular character of American inequality means that race is frequently considered to be a major factor. The late 20th century saw the white middle classes largely abandoning the inner cities, and an increase of white residents is now taken to be a sure sign of gentrification. But this metric can t apply in less politically segregated contexts.. What s more, the evidence of whether victims of gentrification are primarily displaced or simply. further impoverished. For example, a Dutch communications firm has conducted. crowdsourced research. One infamous metric is the coffee shop. Academics have looked at correlations between the. prevalence of coffee shops.   legitimately  up and coming .. Other innovations came from Cambridge academics, who compared data on deprivation against the. use of social media. . . . . Gentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution. . . . . 
Read more. Even more clever is a study of Chicago that included images from Google Street View to exclude non-gentrifying forms of value-increase. The rationale was that.  the visible streetscape of neighbourhoods provides direct indicators of change . Taken together, what the wide variety of research shows is that a single, universal measurement of gentrification is probably impossible, with all the fraught political and cultural considerations at work.. Nonetheless, what all studies take as their basis is the affordability of, and access, to housing. The fundamental force of gentrification is a rapid upward change in these costs. Across the world, the. highest rises in residential property. Even so, it s not enough: while Shenzhen has seen a staggering rise in housing costs (nearly 50%), it would be hard to say that. this brand-new megacity. Istanbul, with a rise last year of 25%, is one of the starkest examples. In 2013, the proposed redevelopment of a public space into a shopping mall sparked the Gezi Park protests   and a campaign familiar to anti-gentrification activists worldwide took on a whole new dimension, demonstrating just how embedded the issue is with all other political struggles. Above all, it s this fact   that gentrification so often opens the floodgates to more cataclysmic urban change   that shows just how important it is that it can be identified and measured..

Spread across vast expanses of asphalt and multi-storey concrete structures, these parking spots take up about half the mall s 5.2m sq ft, on what was once the edge of the city of Edmonton. A few blocks away, a similar amount of space is taken up by a neighbourhood of nearly 500 homes.. Despite its huge scale, the West Edmonton Mall s parking lot is not all that different from most car parks around the world. Requiring roughly 200 sq ft per car plus room to maneuvre, they tend to be big, flat and not fully occupied. Often their size eclipses the buildings they serve.. Even when they re hidden in underground structures or built into skyscrapers, car parks are big and often empty: parking at homes tends to be vacant during the workday, parking at work vacant at night. A. 2010 study. The US has long been the world leader in building parking spaces. During the mid 20th century, city zoning codes began to include requirements and quotas for most developments to include parking spaces. The supply skyrocketed. A. 2011 study. . . . . Nobody goes to a city because it has great parking. . Michael Kodransky. . .  As parking regulations were put into zoning codes, most of the downtowns in many cities were just completely decimated,  says Michael Kodransky, global research manager for the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy.  What the cities got, in effect, was great parking. But nobody goes to a city because it has great parking. . Increasingly, cities are rethinking this approach. As cities across the world begin to prioritise walkable urban development and the type of city living that does not require a car for every trip, city officials are beginning to move away from blanket policies of providing abundant parking. Many are adjusting zoning rules that require certain minimum amounts of parking for specific types of development. Others are tweaking prices to discourage driving as a default when other options are available. Some are even actively preventing new parking spaces from being built.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
A road in San Francisco. Photograph: Getty. To better understand how much parking they have and how much they can afford to lose, transportation officials in San Francisco in 2010 released the results of what s believed to be the first citywide census of parking spaces. They counted every publicly accessible parking space in the city, including lots, garages, and free and metered street parking. They found that the city had. 441,541 spaces.  The hope was that it would show that there s actually a lot of parking here. We re devoting a lot of space in San Francisco to parking cars,  says Hank Willson, principal analyst at the. San Francisco. Knowing the parking inventory has made it easier for the city to pursue public space improvements such as adding bike lanes or. parklets. The data helps planners to understand when new developments actually need to provide parking spaces and when the available inventory is sufficient. More often, the data shows that the city can t build its way out of a parking shortage   whether it s perceived or real   and that the answers lie in alternative transportation options.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

At the same time, we re seeing occupancy go down by a very small amount. So what that s telling us is the demand for this public parking is going down slightly,  Austin says.  And that could be alarming if we were also seeing some decline of economic activity, but actually that s happening at the same time as we re seeing employment go up and retail vibrancy go up. . . And though many cities in the US are changing zoning and parking requirements to reduce or even eliminate parking minimums, cities in Europe are taking a more forceful approach. Zurich, has been among the most aggressive. In 1996, the city decreed that there would be. no more parking. Copenhagen has also been reducing the amount of parking in the central city. Pedestrianising shopping streets raising prices of parking and licences and developing underground facilites on the city s outskirts has seen city-centre parking spaces shrink and the proportion of people driving to work fall from 22% to 16%.. Paris has been even more aggressive. Starting in 2003, the city began. eliminating on-street parking. . . . . A world without cars: cities go car-free for the day - in pictures. . . . .

And as cities begin to think more carefully about how parking relates to their urban development, their density and their transit accessibility, it s likely that parking spaces will continue to decline around the world..  Ultimately parking needs to be tackled as part of a package of issues,  Kodransky says.  It s been viewed in this super-narrow way, it s been an afterthought. But increasingly cities are waking up to the fact that they have this sleeping giant, these land uses that are not being used in the most optimal way. . Follow Guardian Cities on. Twitter.

In the few decades leading up to the 1979 Islamic revolution, architects such as Houshang Seyhoun, Kamran Diba and Hossein Amanat pushed the boundaries of traditional Persian architecture by using traditional elements in modern designs; Amanat s freedom tower epitomises those efforts.. After the revolution, however, the Iranian capital s architectural scene suffered a serious blow as the country was consumed first by war then by postwar reconstruction. But more recently, with young architects educating themselves in worldwide trends, and the relative stability of the country compared to its post-revolutionary upheaval, a new generation are following in the footsteps of the veterans.

We ve seen too many times in Tehran that 150-year-old or 200-year-old trees are cut for creation of new flats,  he said.  In my project, we faced a total of 128 trees with an average age of 70 years.  The initial plan required around 40 trees to be cut, but Nikbakht redesigned and persuaded the municipality to preserve all of them..  We tried to protect them by covering them up during the construction. One tree dried up and another caught fire   the rest remained intact,  Nikbakht says. The residential complex has two blocks and each have five floors.

"Is the mass sharing of driverless cars about to reshape our suburbs?"," Sidewalk Labs believes personal car ownership is about to become history, making suburbs more accessible and better for walking and cycling. But what if it simply means people shove each child into a different car to get to school?    A world without cars   in pictures    A few months ago I interviewed Klaus Bondam, head of the  Danish cycling union  and formerly Copenhagen s mayor for roads and infrastructure, and asked him how he saw his city changing in the coming years.

I think it s going to be a combination of shared cars, of city cars, of public transport, bicycles, electric bicycles, of freight distribution by electric cargo bikes. . This sounded like a rapid timeframe, I told him. Bondam was adamant:  I m totally convinced about that. Why on earth would you make a big investment that you just leave outside 95% of the time and don t use? . This was, of course, Copenhagen, which already has. very high levels of cycling. The key element of this is the advent of the driverless car. These might seem something for the distant future, but the technology is already affecting people s lives   car insurance premiums are. predicted to plummet. Leading the way on driverless technology are tech firms,. notably Google. . . . . How driverless cars could change our whole future | John Naughton. . . . . 
Read more. All this inevitably draws engineers towards the idea of car sharing. As Bondam notes, each person, or family, having their own car is absurdly inefficient and leaves everyone, car user or not, having to deal with external factors such as streets cluttered with parked vehicles, and cars crawling along looking for parking.. Sharing systems already exist in many cities, not least bike networks of the type seen in. London. Paris. New York. One Google-spinoff company is trying to look further into the future for more radical solutions. Anand Babu, chief operating officer at. Sidewalk Labs. The intention of Sidewalk Labs is to reshape cities through the conjunction of clever planning and hi-tech solutions. It is working on. LinkNYC. Flow. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
A LinkNYC kiosk in New York. Babu, formerly head of special projects for. Google. And while he stresses the risks in trying to predict the future, Babu says there could soon be big and interconnected changes for transport in what he calls the  20-100mph range    cars and what might replace them   and the  10-20mph range , covering cycling and other more short-range travel modes.. Driverless cars, Babu says, could have a particular impact in expansive US cities, making often moribund outer suburbs easily accessible and more attractive, in turn relieving the pressure on people to live in the centre. With mass driverless car sharing, he argues, you would need far fewer vehicles overall, leaving neighbourhoods much more attractive for walking or cycling.. Babu believes there is  tremendous latent demand  for people to live in communities based around walking and bikes. As he sees it, the suburb (or inner city) of the future would see people hop on a bike either for local trips or to access to the next, more rapid form of transport, be it a driverless car or public transport..  You could potentially move to a model where these suburban cities that were so reliant on individual vehicles could become incredibly well-connected metropolitan areas, where you could get anywhere within 30 minutes, plus a first mile/last mile of walking or bike connection,  he says.  You re in a high-speed, shared vehicle for the majority of miles, but then the last mile or first mile you embrace a wide amount of innovation around all sorts of personal vehicles, whether self-powered or electric powered, to connect. . . . . . There s an alternative, scary future where people   shove each of their children into a driverless car to go to school. . Rachel Aldred. . . The idea of a company such as Google taking an interest in cycling might seem anomalous. But urban cycling, like shared cars, can appeal to tech firms  focus on efficient and adaptable technology.. Google announced last year a. plan to combat road congestion. It followed research into local commuting patterns that found 20% to 30% of trips were under five miles   perfectly achievable on a bike in the agreeable local climate.. This slightly Truman Show-style image of cities filled with benign, never-crashing, always-available shared cars does, however, come with various caveats.. For example, it s perfectly possible people might eschew Babu s first or last mile on a bike or e-bike and get driven right to their door, thus keeping traffic on residential roads and doing nothing to improve the globe s ongoing pandemic of ailments associated with sedentary living.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
 Cities could move to a model where you could get anywhere within 30 minutes with a first mile/last mile bike connection,  says Anand Babu of Sidewalk Labs. Photograph: Alamy. Also, with cars often criticised for their depersonalising and divisive effect on urban life, this atomisation could increase all the more if they are simply replaced by driverless versions.. Rachel Aldred. Aldred continues:  We need to do more thinking about what exactly we want driverless cars used for, and who will use them. The trade-offs are not always recognised..  On the one hand people say they ll be much more efficient, which would spare road capacity, which is great if that is the case. But on the other hand it will open up the benefits of car mobility to many more people, who currently have limited access. You can t have it both ways. . . . . . Can e-bikes revolutionise long-distance commuting?. . . . . 
Read more. Which way will it go? What does seem very possible is that the hegemony of the private car, seen for so many decades as immutable and permanent, could end sooner than many people think, maybe even within Bondam s predicted timeframe.. Fifty years ago, the business behemoths of the day were collaborating with city planners to drive urban motorways through city centres. These are now gradually being removed   as with, for example, Paris s. decision to close the Voie Georges-Pompidou. The new industrial giants, such as Google, are looking beyond antiquated issues like free-flowing motor traffic and towards cities in which people enjoy living.. They won t always get it right. Babu excitedly told me about the potential for low-cost, lightweight carbon-fibre cycle flyovers, which might be technologically nifty but fall into the classic trap of seeing the bike as something to be removed from a city rather than placed at its centre.. But the fact he and other tech innovators are even thinking such things is encouraging. The transport revolution is coming. You ll just have to wait to see precisely how it looks..

"Paradise lost: does Copenhagen s Christiania commune still have a future?"," For 45 years, Christiania has stood as a community-led utopia, its cannabis trade central to a liberal culture. But the shooting of a police officer has forced residents to take radical action. As the smoke clears, will it ever be the same again?  Late in the evening on  Wednesday 31 August , gunshots were fired in the centre of Christiania, Copenhagen s semi-autonomous freetown. Three people were injured, including one police officer, who remains in critical condition. The gunman   a 25-year-old Dane who was later shot and killed by the police   is believed to have been involved in Christiania s hash trade.  Cannabis has long been sold and enjoyed in this unique neighbourhood, a famous utopian commune in the heart of Denmark s capital. Historically a centre of freedom and resistance, it will celebrate on Monday the  45th anniversary  of the day that squatters   known as  slumstormerene    broke down the barricades of an abandoned military base, creatively activating disused spaces in a time when living conditions were poor. In 1973, the Social Democratic government gave Christiania the official temporary status of  social experiment    a term that many criticised as its residents had not agreed to participate. Nonetheless, this ruling allowed Christiania to persist, and a majority vote in parliament in 1989 set the Christiania Law in stone, legalising the squat.   Continue reading...

Christiania s Pusher Street. Photograph: Athlyn Cathcart-Keays for the Guardian. The community also has its own social services in cooperation with the municipality, known as Herfra og Videre (Onwards and Upwards), as well as a health centre. With the exception of schools, hospitals and social services, Christiania likes to do things its own way. It has established a self-administrating system that spends 29m kroner ( 3.3m) annually on maintaining common property, kindergartens, sewers, recycling and waste collection.. Drug use was always a part of the community. In recent years, however, the cannabis trade has evolved. Once led by small-time dealers, it is now controlled by large, multinational organisations, including the Danish branch of the. Hell s Angels. . . . . Controlled legalisation would be a better way to regulate the cannabis market than the current prohibition. . Frank Jensen. . .  This transition has happened over many years,  says Risenga Manghezi, a community spokesperson who has lived in Christiania for seven years.  In the last 10 to 15 years, the police have been really hard on Pusher Street. This means the softer  mom-and-pop shops  have disappeared, and it s only the ones who are most willing to take risks and manipulate Christianites who have stayed. . Recent figures from the Copenhagen police estimate that between. up to 1bn.  Today you have pre-rolled joints, different types of hash,  says Manghezi.  It s all very systemised and there is a lot of money going through there. . In this otherwise semi-autonomous and socially minded community, a capitalist-style  drugs supermarket  had developed, and was spinning out of control   culminating in the recent shootout.  This was something most of us knew could happen,  Manghezi says.  It s not the first time somebody s been shot in Christiania. But I ve always thought that the day a police officer gets shot, that s the day things will get really bad. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
A Christiania resident demolishes a cannabis stall following last month s shooting. Photograph: Scanpix Denmark/Reuters. Indeed, the next evening, roughly 400 of Christiania s 700 adult residents gathered in the community s meeting space. The democratic process in Christiania is based on a. consensus mechanism. Some gangs, however, have manipulated locals into acting as a front for their trade. Their presence at meetings, Manghezi laments, makes it difficult to build momentum to change the way Pusher Street is run. But this time it was clear something drastic would happen: by the end of the meeting, residents had decided to. demolish all stalls in the  cannabis supermarket .  The whole vibe around Pusher Street has really sucked a lot of the energy out of Christiania. This has been a wakeup call for what we have here,  says Manghezi.  Police confrontation around Pusher Street has halted a lot of the great things that could go on. I hope that what we ve done will now release some new energy so we can focus on the cool things happening. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest. 
Ole Lykke. Photograph: Athlyn Cathcart-Keays. Since the stalls were destroyed, the atmosphere is noticeably different: pop-up community meals have taken place, and there is talk of plans for a fountain. There have always been a lot of positive lessons to learn from this alternative urban enclave. The community continuously experiments with green building techniques, stormwater management, solar energy and water-treatment systems to reduce their ecological footprint. Christiania s creativity and experimentation has always existed, but the presence of Pusher Street has dominated the focus.  It has made people sort of not talk about the social experiment,  says Manghezi.  It s given the general feeling that things we do here are illegal   they really aren t! . This freedom to experiment is at the core of Christiania s principles. When resident and archivist Ole Lykke first moved to the freetown in 1979, he says,  you d have a good idea, you d go ahead with it, and if somebody complained, you d deal with it. If not, then you d just go ahead. . But. in 2011. buy a little share of freedom. was saved. The mortgage payments rise every year, but this  rent  is immensely cheaper than the rest of central Copenhagen   giving Christiania  the perfect elements for gentrification , says Manghezi. Autonomous or not, Christiania faces the same challenges as many inner-city neighbourhoods when it comes to the pressures of market forces.. Just across the water, in an area known as Papir en (Paper Island), a former paper factory is being colonised by a food market, a gallery and design offices, preparing the area for transformation. into a luxury development.  kissing  bridge.

If you were coming to the area, you either came here or to the ship-building factory, which closed down in 1986. If Christiania hadn t started in these old military barracks, most of this area would ve been torn down. Then they would ve built concrete houses that probably would ve been torn down by now. We saved this area, and have made an attraction in the city. . Indeed, with up to a million annual visitors, Christiania is the Danish capital s second most popular attraction.  Copenhagen needs grassroots movements like Christiania because they add new dimensions and dynamics to our culture and urban life,  says the city s mayor, Frank Jensen.  The city needs to make room for people that give Copenhagen the edge and contributes to making it stand out, nationally and internationally. . . . . .

As the smoke of the gang-dominated hash industry clears, will Christiania still hold the same attraction it once did?.  We cannot allow for the cannabis market to keep funding organised crime,  says Jensen.  We need to find a lasting solution to this problem   I think a carefully controlled legalisation would be a better way to regulate the cannabis market than the current prohibition. . As Ole Lykke watches Christiania s last hash stall being crane-lifted on to the back of a truck, on its way to Copenhagen City Museum to memorialise this latest chapter in a unique community s 45-year story, he considers the implications of what he s seeing.

Read more. After Haiyan  . one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded. killed more than 6,000 people. So far, the plan has been a failure, at least in terms of numbers. In the aftermath of one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit the. Philippines. Last week, vice-president Leni Robredo, newly installed as head of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council   an umbrella organisation that oversees various government housing agencies   admitted that only about 1% of the target had been achieved..  The report reaching us is that only 25,000 were completed,  she said at a press conference.  From the 25,000 that were completed, 2,500 were occupied. . As the third anniversary of the Haiyan disaster approaches on 8 November, hundreds of thousands of people in the Philippines, including tens of thousands in Tacloban, continue to live in areas which the government has designated as  no dwelling zones .. They include residents of Seawall who, like Arsenio, rebuilt their homes after the storm. Their homes are shacks made from what could be found in the wreckage or was donated by charities   plywood, sacking and corrugated iron. Some jut out into the sea, supported on stilts, and are connected to the land by single wooden boards.. Joyce Sierra, advocacy officer at. Social Watch Philippines. Robredo blamed the lack of progress on  red tape , particularly the processing of documents and land titles for sites where homes were to be built. She has said she will coordinate with the Commission on Audit and the National Economic Development Agency (COA) to see if the bureaucracy can be reduced.. The slow grind is frustrating for people like Glenda Nibasa, a housewife living in Tacloban s flood-prone Picas community. As she waits for the government to provide her with a proper home, she s living in a temporary shelter provided by the NGO World Vision..  If the government wants to help us, why are there so many processes? Why won t they just help us?  Nibasa asked.. But constructing new homes is not the end of the problem. Even survivors who are offered the chance to relocate sometimes decide against it, because the inland safe zones are far from their where they work   usually in the fishing industry. They also fear the new homes are a step down in terms of quality of life.. . . . . Typhoon Haiyan: feud hampers reconstruction of Tacloban. . . . .

Ildebrando Bernadas, head of the Tacloban city government s disaster risk reduction and management office, acknowledged the problem with the water supply and said it was because no national agency had been assigned to the problem. Plans are now being drawn up to provide a water supply to Tacloban s relocation  township  in the north of the city, he said.. Bernadas also said Haiyan survivors  concerns about their livelihoods were being addressed, and employment and training were being provided   although it could not be guaranteed that those being relocated, mostly fishermen, would be able to continue with the same job..  Actually, those who are now resettled permanently, that [had previously been] their sentiment:  We don t want to move because our lives here   we are fishermen.  But now they are there, they feel happy about it,  he said.. . . More features. Topics. . .

These are among the sustainable business ideas being showcased in Rio de Janeiro this week at an event that mixes seven startups, three saccharine sweet pop stars and and one fossil-fuel behemoth   Shell   in a campaign to #changetheworld and clean up the latter s dirty corporate image.. Staged in the striking setting of the. Santa Marta favela. Pixie Lott. Luan Santana. Yemi Alade. But for all the fluff, corporate cynicism and the army of media communication consultants, there was just about enough intelligence and idealism on display to ensure the event inspired a little hope as well as suspicion.. The overarching concept was simple: take seven sustainable business ideas that normally receive little attention, then ramp up their prominence and impact with a promotion event in a sexy location with big-name artists who can amplify the message to a young audience through music videos, Snapchat and other social networks.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It was a little weird, nonetheless, to see the world s third most valuable oil company temporarily commandeer a favela to produce a music video about clean energy and stage a press conference with canapguardian canap s for journalists flown in from distant continents. The dissonance was both encouraging and unsettling.. Encouraging because the overriding message was that positive change is possible. Santa Marta is a symbol of that. Fifteen years ago, this community of 8,000 residents   like many favelas in Rio   was off the social grid. Gangs ruled the streets. There was almost zero public or private investment. Residents stole electricity by tapping power lines so there was little incentive to conserve energy or switch to clean power.. But since 2008, when it was the first favela to be  pacified  with a permanent police presence, Dona Marta has become something of a model community. A new cable car has improved access. With crime down, tourism   driven by the spectacular views of Rio and the nearby. Christ the Redeemer statue. Since the end of last year, this is also the site of. a pilot project. Insolar. photovoltaic.  People thought we were crazy when we said we want to promote solar use in poor communities in Rio,  said Insolar founder Henrique Drumond. But he said the creche now gets 70% of its energy from the panels, which means considerable savings on a power bill that   since pacification   has to be paid. With a panel lifespan of 25 years and lots of sun in Rio, the hope is that, over time, residents of other communities will see the benefits and   once a financing system is in place   choose to invest themselves. In that sense, Santa Marta is a shop window.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

Solar brings energy and jobs,  said the community  ambassador  Marcelo de Souza.  We hope this can spread not just in Santa Marta but to all the Rio communities. We want to create not just jobs, but business. . Commercial viability is, however, still a distant prospect for most of the projects being exhibited. A greater priority for now is demonstrating that the technology works and getting the word out. This is where Shell s marketing clout   rather than an equity investment   comes in.. That process is already well underway at. Pavegen.  first player-powered football pitch. inaugurated by Pel . The idea is ingenious, but expensive. Kinetic energy panels are laid under the playing surface. Each step on them generates about five watts (depending on the player s weight). A single five-a-side game can power floodlights for several hours.. Underscoring the importance of public security as well as energy in any development, the founder, Laurence Kemball-Cook, was advised not to return to Morro da Mineira because of rising violence in the unpacified community, but his company s technology was showcased at Santa Marta with a breakdance display.. Kemball-Cook initially had to take risks to push his ideas. He says his first pilot project was installed without permission on a building site on the South Bank and he was also detained for putting one on the steps of 10 Downing Street. Now, however, he has Shell s support,  2m raised from a kickstarter campaign, 40 staff and a growing list of trial sites, including West Ham station, a Kia factory in South Korea and   soon   several entire blocks of a US city. He is hopeful the collaboration with music artists can take it further, increase demand and help to drive the cost down..  If you believe in an idea, you can t just sit on your backside,  he said.  We have great technology, but amplifying it is hard. We partner with artists to amplify it. A 16-year-old won t listen to me or to Shell but, with a song, you can reach them. . The artists   who will collaborate for a promotional video   were chosen to appeal to global youth with one representative from each continent. Of the three who were in Santa Marta this week, Santana has 50 million social media followers, Alade is a Nigerian afropop star, and Lott was recently in a West End show..  The idea is to spread the word about these fantastic ideas,  said Lott, who performed on the roof of a favela creche, while on the street below visitors were shown around display booths.  It is really good to be involved in something so positive and inspiring. These are fantastic ideas that I would have never thought about from people who really care about the world. I hope these things become normal in the future. It is really important for young people to realise it s going on. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

Youth appeal, however, is probably more important for Shell   which needs to greenwash its 100-plus-year history of profiting from dirty carbon fuels   than for the young entrepreneurs, most of whom are more in need of backing from investors and governments.. Take Sanwal Muneer, founder of. Capture Mobility. Arguably the most elegant idea on display was also the simplest.. Gravity Light. Other entrepreneurs get power from waste. China-based. MotionEco. Bio-Bean. On the main road of Santa Marta, the latter were being used to grill chicken kebabs and sausages at one of the ubiquitous street churrascos. Daniel Crockett, the communications head of the three-year-old company, hoped the principle could spread further..  Coffee is just one organic waste stream. If we could spread the idea that this is possible then that would be great,  he said.  But we know that many of these places have more pressing issues of clean water and basic sanitation. . That touched on one of the three unsettling questions raised by the event. Will Santa Marta turn out to be a Potemkin favela used to temporarily showcase the future even as other communities are unable to enjoy the basic services that should be available in the present?. The second question is about Shell s motives. Is it genuinely pushing for an energy transformation, simply hedging its bets, or just engaged in PR to salvage its reputation, particularly among the young ? It is probably no coincidence that #changetheworld comes at a time when there is growing pressure from students for universities and other institutions to. divest their funds from fossil fuel companies. Shell declined to say how much it spent on the project in Santa Marta, though it   and other clean energy investment by the company   was almost certainly minuscule compared with its investments in dirty carbon-based energy. The third question, then, is will that balance shift?. The company s external relations manager, Glauco Paiva, was clear in his answer.  Shell believes the future of energy is renewable,  he said at a press conference in the Santa Marta samba school hall.  The idea is to change the world. . If so, this week s exhibition is a tiny but welcome step in the right direction. But if Shell s investment strategy does not also change substantively, the bright ideas will have been shrouded in a PR sham.. . . More features. Topics. . .

Nigeria might seem to be on track with diversification, but the political risks posed by the 2019 election are obvious. Even if the reserves get a boost, good plans can be undone by a change of government. For Nigeria to continue selling public assets as a short-term fix to a structural problem seems deeply introspective. The bleeding might be delayed but, if the portfolio of national exports is not expanded beyond oil, it will be back to the drawing board. National assets should only be sold as part of a long-term plan that is strictly followed through.. . . More comment. Topics. . .

It is El Salvador s first camp for internally displaced people since the 12-year civil war, when an estimated one million people were forcibly displaced and 80,000 killed.. The war between the leftist guerrillas and US-supported military dictatorships ended in 1992, but peace never came to this small Central American country, where the social and economic inequalities which triggered the conflict remain unresolved. Social exclusion, state repression and gang violence have steadily grown worse, and in recent years,. El Salvador. Ironically, the region around Caluco was spared much of the civil war bloodletting, said the local mayor, Bianca Oriana, who set up the camp in the shadows of the Santa Ana volcano.  In this area, we were not badly affected by the war violence. For us, the gangs are much worse,  she said.. . map. The Caluco camp serves as the latest stark warning that extreme violence is again displacing huge numbers of Salvadorans, forcing entire families to leave home in search of safety.. More than 1,000 people, including several entire communities, are known to have been internally displaced since the beginning of 2015, according to human rights activists in El Salvador. The actual number is likely to be much higher.. Tens of thousands more have fled the country altogether.

While the worst violence was once concentrated in deprived urban areas, it has since spread to small towns and rural communities.. Caluco is a picturesque semi-rural district with about 9,000 inhabitants. About seven years ago, Barrio 18 Sure os   one of the three largest gangs in the country - started forming. clicas,.  At first they didn t cause any problems, it was just about belonging to something  but then came the drugs and violence,  said Oriana.. According to local people, around three years ago, the gang leaders suddenly started carrying high-calibre weapons and pressuring families to cooperate: providing money and food whenever demanded, or acting as lookouts for police or soldiers.. The murder rate inched up steadily, despite the presence of an army base in the district; one by one, families started to leave.. One of the worst-affected communities was El Casta o, where a 64-year-old man called Francisco Barrientos was killed after allegedly refusing to cooperate with a gang led by one of his nephews. His relatives responded by burning down the house of the gang leader s mother..  We knew this was a declaration of war, but I am happy we did it,  said a family member, who asked not to be named.

Thailand is not hiding anything and is ready to disclose everything,  he said, adding that other countries in south-east Asia might also have cases of Zika-linked microcephaly that they have not disclosed.. The WHO said Thailand s response was an example for the region..  Thailand s diligence underscores the commitment of health authorities to the health and wellbeing of the Thai public, and provides a positive example to be emulated,  Singh said.. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday people should consider postponing travel to Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam.. The CDC has already issued a  travel notice  for Singapore, and said such a warning would be considered for the new countries if the number of cases rose to the level of an outbreak.. Thailand s confirmation of Zika-linked microcephaly comes ahead of China s week-long  Golden Week  holiday, with Thailand expecting 220,000 Chinese visitors, up from 168,000 for the week in 2015, said Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand.. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika. An estimated 80% of people infected have no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected.. There are also no specific tests to determine if a baby will be born with microcephaly, but ultrasound scans in the third trimester of pregnancy can identify the problem, according to the WHO.. Zika is commonly transmitted through mosquitoes but can also be transmitted sexually.. Another Thai health ministry adviser urged everyone to work to stop the spread of mosquitoes but said people should not panic..  Don t have sex with a Zika-infected person. If you don t know if they are infected, then use a condom,  said the adviser, Pornthep Siriwanarangsan.  We can t stop women from becoming pregnant   but we mustn t panic. . Health authorities in the region said they were stepping up monitoring, but there has been little testing and officials said the real number of cases was bound to be higher than the confirmed figure..  We do not test everybody, we test only those who are symptomatic,  said Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubia, health secretary in the Philippines, which has reported 12 Zika cases..  Yes, we are positive that the number is higher because we are not testing everyone. . Malaysia, which has reported six cases of Zika, including two in pregnant women, said it would seek information from Thailand on the particular strain of the Zika virus there..  We are taking serious notice of the reports in Thailand, and we will reach out to the Thai authorities for more information   so that we can be more prepared,  said Malaysia s health minister, Subramaniam Sathasivam.. Authorities in Vietnam, which has reported three cases of Zika, ordered increased monitoring of pregnant women.. In Indonesia s capital, Jakarta, Dwi Oktavia, head of disease outbreak and surveillance, said there had been no sign of any increase in birth defects. Indonesia had one Zika case in 2015 but has had no confirmed cases since.. Microcephaly in babies can lead to respiratory problems related to malformation of the brain, a serious threat to the lives of babies.

For years, some Peruvians assumed that being short was a trait that was innate to the country s indigenous people, until a multi-pronged campaign of health checks, a conditional cash transfer scheme and public spending managed to halve childhood stunting in less than a decade.. In the seven years between. 2007 and 2014 stunting among children under five dropped from 29% to 14%. National Statistics Institute. . stunting in Peru. What is remarkable about the achievement was the coordination between government ministries, regional governments, health professionals and NGOs to focus on specific goals and targeted policy efforts to convert Peru s impressive economic growth into a reduction in child stunting caused by chronic undernutrition.. In 2000 about one in three Peruvian children under five suffered from chronic malnutrition. Several years later, despite an estimated $200m ( 154m) spent on nutrition programmes every year, the stunting rate had barely budged an inch, says Alessandra Marini, a senior World Bank economist and leader of the. Peru.  We had to try and change the understanding of the problem,  Marini told the Guardian. Chronic malnutrition and chronic growth retardation of children was related not just to their diet but to the high prevalence of diarrhoea due to poor sanitation, respiratory infections and poor breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in the under-twos, she explained.. The first thousand days in a child s life became the focus. The World Bank backed the conditional cash transfer scheme Juntos (Together) which, between 2005 and 2015, more than doubled regular health and growth checkups for children in their first three years, and school attendance for older children, in return for a. monthly cash payment of about $30. poverty is more than 50%.  Juntos was the engine behind the change. It was critical because it was creating incentives for women,  said Marini. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers were expected to attend antenatal and postnatal checkups and have a medically assisted delivery. Families with children aged under five had to have regular checkups for growth monitoring, receipt of fortified complementary food and vitamin supplements, vaccinations and deworming.. . . . . Malnutrition linked to nearly half of deaths among under-fives. . . . .

But education was also key, explains Marini as  indigenous communities were just convinced that just being indigenous you were expected to be short ..  Our work was making sure that everyone understood that between the ages of zero and five every child in the world has the same growth potential,  she said.. Ariela Luna, former policy minister for the development and social inclusion ministry, said that combating infant malnutrition counted on  explicit presidential and governmental support and targeted public spending  which meant using the evidence-based. Articulated Nutrition Programme. The finance ministry, which holds the purse strings for the other ministries in Peru, played a key role in mobilising other stakeholders and prioritising investments in areas of more stunting, said Marini.. Nathalye Zu iga, a technical coordinator with Juntos, says  nature has given [Peru] a lot  in terms of nutrition, yet the population needed to learn how to combine the variety of foods.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The general agreement is that money is there, but money is also scarce because you cannot get it in a simple way,  Shiferaw Teklemariam, Ethiopia s minister for the environment, forestry and climate change, said at the conference earlier this month.  We need to simplify the processes and make them more accessible. . The gathering was hosted by the. Global Growth Institute (GGGI).  Shiferaw said Ethiopia estimates that it will need at least $7.5bn ( 5.8bn) over the next decade in order to meet its targets on green growth. He emphasised that the  financial resources gap  was the biggest challenge to Ethiopia s quest for growth that reduces poverty, increases social inclusion and promotes environmental sustainability..  Mahua Acharya, GGGI s assistant director general, said that designers of development projects are not speaking the language that institutional investors want to hear.  The supply of capital is not a problem,  she said.  It is the moving of that money into a project. . She said financiers find many prospective projects either too risky or not rewarding enough, pointing out that in 2014 only $391bn of the trillions sitting in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries was made available for green finance.. In a speech to open the conference, which gathered hundreds of delegates from 50 countries, GGGI s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, called for the walls between available finance and unfunded green projects to be knocked down.. He said more money for sustainable development has become available from private investors and public donors, as the world has realised that modern economic growth   in Asia, for example   has come at a huge cost to the environment and has exacerbated inequality. In 2013,. $193bn out of a total $331bn.  Somewhat ironically, we still frequently hear of projects struggling to find finance, and financiers struggling to find projects,  said Yudhoyono, a former president of Indonesia.. Acharya said the GGGI has been working to set up an investment service, involving mainly people with banking backgrounds, to support countries in preparing projects that appeal to the private sector. In the pipeline are ventures in India, Mongolia, Vanuatu and Indonesia, she said.. . . . . Want to beat climate change and achieve sustainability?

I tried screaming but there was cloth inside my mouth. . Khadija, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, says she was left locked inside the house for four days  without food or medicine . Eventually, the police were alerted. They raided the house, extracting her through a smashed window.. As Khadija explains her nightmare, she constantly wipes away tears and turns her sunken eyes towards the window, to be sure no one is coming to get her. She is in genuine fear for her life.. The woman accused of cutting her, Elsie Kondoromoh, is an influential figure in. Sierra Leone. Police inspector Marty Tarawille said:  [Kondoromoh] was with us [at the police station] but the sowei people came in numbers  They were singing, they were shouting that we should leave that lady [alone]   If we had not released her it would have been a problem for us in this station. .

September 16, 2016. FGM has been banned in the country since emergency health measures were introduced after the Ebola outbreak in 2014. But despite the continued ban,. the practice has returned through all-female secret societies, the Bondo. In August, a young woman died in the northern town of Makeni shortly. after undergoing the procedure. The World Health Organisation estimates that. 88% of women in Sierra Leone. That the women who converged on the police station were able to secure Kondoromoh s release is indicative of the power soweis wield in Sierra Leonean culture. Civil society organisations have called for Khadija to be evacuated from the town, expressing concern for her safety, but fear of the soweis is such that campaigners are afraid to come to the fore..  The soweis are so powerful that nowhere in Sierra Leone will be safe for her again,  one activist says.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

Kondoromoh, who is national vice-president of the Sowei council, admits she carried out the procedure but says she did not force Khadija to go through with it. She claims Khadija asked for it..  She met me at home saying she was being taunted by her fellow women because she had not been circumcised,  says Kondoromoh.  She came to me to initiate her and asked how much it would cost. I told her that I did not want anything from her because she was being provoked. I took her to a nearby society bush to initiate her .. Kondoromoh says Khadija asked to stay with her until she recovered because she would be taunted if she went back home:  I bought her provision. I woke up every morning to prepare food for her before leaving home. . Medics treating Khadija say her condition is improving, but predict it will take some time for her to heal both medically and psychologically. One nurse described her as  badly traumatised ..  With elections in early 2018, it is unlikely the government will take any serious action against the soweis, who will now be emboldened by their apparent success in having their way,  says a local journalist whose radio station has been threatened if it continues to cover the issues surrounding FGM..

Read more. Yet new. analysis. Democrats recall a contrasting economic approach, that of. Bill Clinton. This new ideological battle, between Reaganomics and Clintonomics, exploded last week at a. debate.  This is a very fundamental difference between trickle-down economics and bottom-up economics,  said Gene Sperling, who was director of the National Economic Council during the Bill Clinton administration and is now an economic adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign..  We believe that a stronger middle class is what leads to greater economic growth. [The Trump campaign says cutting] taxes for the most well off will lead to dynamic growth that will trickle down to the middle class. There is no evidence that this has worked. . Perhaps the only thing both sides agree on is that the difference between them is huge..  This is a night-and-day election,  said Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump who argues the Reagan tax cuts led to the  one of the biggest booms in American history .. . . . . We believe that a stronger middle class is what leads to greater economic growth. . Gene Sperling, Clinton adviser. . .  You couldn t have two more opposing economic outlooks,  he said, adding:  Yes, we borrowed a lot of money in the Reagan years but we rebuilt the American economy in an incredible way. We want to cut taxes to make the economy grow. She wants to raise taxes to make the government grow. . Both parties are less keen to trumpet the economic policies of the last two presidents, who took similar paths to their party predecessors, with more mixed results.. Trump advisers argue that Clinton is complacent about slow wage growth under Barack Obama, a measure that has improved recently but which remains flat given growing employment and share prices..  Most Americans feel that this recovery has been no recovery at all,  Moore said.  If people feel pretty good in November, when they go to the polls, then Hillary will win. But if people want real change, and I think they do, then Trump will win a landslide election. . . . . . If people feel pretty good in November, Hillary will win. But if people want real change   Trump will win a landslide. . Stephen Moore, Trump adviser. . . Democrats.  The problems we have stem mostly from the financial crisis,  Sperling said,  which was not a failure of progressive policies but stemmed from a period of cutting taxes for the most well off and a hands-off approach to Wall Street. . Sperling, who also served as a senior adviser to Obama, conceded that economic and wage growth could be much better.

I do believe you can have 4% private sector growth because that s what happened under Bill Clinton,  he said.  That was while he raised taxes from 31% to 39.6%.

Trump supporters also argue that their approach is misunderstood, insisting that cutting corporation tax to 15% and offsetting income tax reductions by closing loopholes would not necessarily reduce overall taxes for the rich..  A lot of rich people own small businesses,  said Moore.  But you know what? They hire people. The evidence is overwhelmingly clear that to get higher wages you need business investment. And that s not what is happening right now..  If we do this, we think we can see rising incomes not for the rich but for middle-class Americans. We feel very proud of that. We feel it s the centrepiece of our plan. . The Trump campaign claims the outcome will not be the rising inequality feared by Democrats but $2tn of new investment and a 9% increase in average wages.. Clinton wants to spend heavily on infrastructure and job programmes she says will boost the economy by putting more money into the pockets of middle-class consumers..

"Celebrity consent: stop branding attacks on women as 'pranks'"," Gigi Hadid faced criticism when she defended herself against an attacker this week. But why do men who manhandle women in the street continue to be cast as harmless jokers?  Picture the scene: a male celebrity is exiting an event when suddenly someone runs up to him, dodging his security team, and attempts to grab his wallet from his pocket. Reacting instinctively, the celebrity puts up a hand to stop the attacker, perhaps pushing them away or to the ground. Headlines relay the shocking event, many praising the  action hero  for his real-life reflexes.   Yet while our sympathies would likely be firmly aligned with a famous man facing an attempted robbery, the reaction seems to be very different when female celebrities experience what amounts to attempted assault.

Readers are much better at asking smart questions than I am, which is why I have been ending each of these articles with a request to get in touch with me. Earlier this week, Alan wrote me an email which asked:. I would like to know more about what supporters of the Greens and Libertarians will actually do on US polling day. Do we expect them to vote for their own lost causes as a principled act of faith, stay at home or switch to a mainstream party?. It s a great question. For now, though, I m going to set aside what these individuals are going to do on November 8   partly because I think predictive journalism is having a. bad effect on democracy. Instead, I want to take one step back and consider just how many Americans are considering a choice that isn t Democrat. Hillary Clinton. There are a lot of them. According to Real Clear Politics  polling. averages. Unfortunately for them, candidates whose surnames aren t Clinton or Trump have approximately a 0% chance of winning any states, let alone the election. But they could nevertheless influence national results by affecting other candidates  vote share. The numbers on this are pretty fascinating right now.. Contrary to popular belief, third-party votes don t just come from would-be Democratic voters   they appear to be coming equally from potential Republicans. One way to measure this is to contrast Clinton and Trump s vote shares in a. two-way race. four-way race. The problem for Hillary is that three percentage points just isn t good enough, especially when you take into account the inaccuracies of polling. The two leading candidates are pretty much neck and neck and recent political history suggests that could be a big problem for Clinton.. In 2000, the Green party presidential candidate Ralph Nader played a huge role in. securing. polling. .

"Spanish Socialists' week of turmoil not just down to Pedro S nchez"," PSOE is consumed by  Corbynisation  as its leader is blamed for Spain s political stalemate, but analysts say decline did not start with him  As a man who dreams daily of defenestrating the Spanish Socialists and setting his own party on their leftist throne, Pablo Iglesias is perhaps not the most impartial observer of the  very public war that has devoured the PSOE party  this week.  And yet the Podemos leader s analysis of the attempted coup against his PSOE counterpart, Pedro S nchez, was neither gleefully apocalyptic nor giddily triumphant.

As a man who dreams daily of defenestrating the Spanish Socialists and setting his own party on their leftist throne, Pablo Iglesias is perhaps not the most impartial observer of the. very public war that has devoured the PSOE party. And yet the. Podemos. Years of simmering discontent with S nchez finally. boiled over on Wednesday. had performed disastrously in regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country. December. June. Felipe Gonz lez, the political powerhouse who led the party to four election victories in the 1980s and 90s, spoke out midweek, accusing S nchez of lying to him.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Gonzalez now says he feels  cheated  by S nchez for failing to end Spain s nine-month political deadlock. Photograph: Paul White/AP. In the days following the June election, said Gonz lez, S nchez had assured him that he was going to respect the wishes of many in the PSOE by dropping his objection to allowing Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative People s party, (PP) to form a minority government.. But despite growing pressure to give in   thereby breaking the political deadlock that has left Spain without a government for nine months  . S nchez bluntly refused. thoroughly steeped in corruption allegations as the PP. Hours after Gonz lez s intervention, half of the PSOE s executive committee resigned. The anti-S nchez lobby had calculated that the move would force the dissolution of the committee, unseat the leader and leave the party in the hands of a caretaker team. It did not.. S nchez and his supporters argue that party rules make it clear that he is still in charge and have called a meeting of the PSOE s 295-member federal committee on Saturday. At the top of the agenda will be plans to hold a back-me-or-sack-me leadership contest on 23 October.. With neither side giving ground   nor quarter   the skirmishes will only get bloodier as the battle for the soul of the party intensifies. Just to make matters worse, the deadline is looming for the formation of a new government: if party leaders cannot reach a compromise by 31 October, King Felipe will dissolve parliament and. Spain will find its Christmas interrupted by its third general election. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Facebook. . . . Twitter. . . . Pinterest.

Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, says that while internal conflict is nothing new in the PSOE, the current levels of  entrenchment and acrimony  are unprecedented.. According to Pablo Sim n, a political science professor at Madrid s Carlos III University, this week s internecine strife has once again shown that few things are more dangerous than a botched coup..  You have to be a bit careful with the analogy, but when someone makes an internal move to bring about a coup and that coup fails, you get a civil war between two camps,  he says..  And that s exactly where we are now: two camps who both claim irreconcilable legitimacy and who will finally have to come face to face tomorrow. . Other analogies suggest themselves, too. Sim n refers to the party s drama as  the Corbynisation of the PSOE . Like his British counterpart, S nchez can be viewed   through his opposition to doing deals with the PP   as a man of principle banking on grassroots support to keep him safe from attacks from his colleagues.. Similarly, Susana D az, the PSOE leader in Andaluc a and his likeliest challenger, portrays herself as a figure trying to reconnect the party with disgruntled voters and save it from the overriding interests of a single individual.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

S nchez s electoral record has been deeply disappointing and he has alienated not only colleagues and voters but also external supporters. In an excoriating editorial on Thursday, El Pa s called him an  unscrupulous fool who would rather destroy the party he has led so calamitously than recognise his enormous failure ..  It s undeniable that the party has had its worst results under S nchez,  says Barroso.  But the decline of PSOE did not start with him. . He points to the. radical economic U-turn performed by the then Socialist prime minister Jos  Luis Rodr guez Zapatero. Add to that the emergence of Podemos, shifting territorial politics   not to mention a wider political malaise   and the reasons for both S nchez s woes and those of his party become painfully clear..  Why is the PSOE eating itself away?  asks Sim n.  There s the crisis of international social democracy, plus memories of Zapatero s economic management, plus the pro-independence process that has deprived it of its key store of votes in Catalonia, plus a rival party to its left that is taking its votes from under-35s and those on peripheral areas..  These four simultaneous crises make it very difficult to lead the party no matter who the leader is. . Regardless of what happens in Saturday s meeting and over the coming days, the prognosis for the PSOE is bleak. And while many will blame S nchez s obstinacy for bolstering Rajoy s position and driving some socialist voters into the wide-flung arms of Podemos and its allies, the party s troubles run far deeper than one man s failings.. . .

"9,000 seats in BPOs! Chance for many to work in their hometowns","NEW DELHI: IT Ministry today said it has given its in-principal approval for around 9,000 seats in business process outsourcing (BPO) units across several small cities of the country, including Varanasi, Siliguri and Patna.  ""I remember during my visit to Bengaluru, people from North-East, Bihar and other places asked me to do something so that they can work in their hometowns. I am happy that with BPOs in small towns, people will be able to work without any need to leave their native place,"" IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said while inaugurating a BPO workshop.  He said India holds 38 per cent share in the global BPO industry and stage is set for a massive growth in the sector.  ""I see a lot of scope for BPOs in Indian language,"" Prasad said.  Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) Joint Secretary Rajiv Kumar said Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) have given in-principal approval for 9,020 seats and is expected to finalise 3,000 more in third round of bidding that started today.  More than 50 companies will set up BPO operations at 60 locations in 18 states and 2 union territories, including Varanasi, Unnao, Patna, Amravati, Dhule, Siliguri, Cuttak, Dalsinghsarai and Muzaffarpur.  STPI officials could recall name of only TCS, Amazon among big companies that have participated in the bids for BPOs.  The Centre under its BPO promotion scheme will provide financial support for total of 48,300 seats to be set up across country with total outlay of Rs 493 crore. The scheme has provision to provide 50 per cent of actual expenditure with cap of Rs 1 lakh per seat.  ""In tier 2 and 3 cities, possibilities are more compared to tier 1 cities. If we move to tier 2 and 3 cities, it will be cost effective and also generate employment. We have to address problems related to innovation and transformation of sectors,"" Minister of State for IT and Law P P Chaudhary said.  MEITY Additional Secretary Ajay Kumar said there are more than 40 mobile phone companies that have started manufacturing in India and ample opportunities are being created under the Digital India programme which will fuel growth of BPOs.  ""Industry needs to find a way with which it can leverage outsourcing demand in the country. Largest health management system is going to be set up this year. GST network is being set up which will require huge work at the back-end and create opportunities for IT companies,"" Kumar said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/it-minister-approves-9000-seats-for-call-centres-in-small-towns/articleshow/54659119.cms","Mon, 03 Oct 2016 13:22:15 GMT","NA","Not Applibale"," IT Minister approves 9,000 seats for call centres in small towns.

"BSF personnel was killed by terrorists or had fallen victim to 'friendly fire' in Baramulla?","SRINAGAR: Confusion prevailed over the terror attack at Army-BSF camp in Baramulla on Sunday night which was described by senior para-military officials on Monday as a ' shoot and scoot+ ' strike by terrorists in which one BSF personnel was killed.  A sentry of 40th battalion of BSF located at Janbazpora in the outskirts of the city located in North Kashmir spotted some suspicious movement+ near the open kitchen area and started firing apprehending that terrorists may have entered into the camp, sources said.  The firing led to panic in adjacent Army camp where troops of 46 Rashtriya Rifles also started firing in the direction in which suspected terrorists were believed to have entered.  Firing continued from all sides and it was not clear whether some terrorists had entered the campus or firing was coming from outside. After 90 minutes of firing, illuminators were used to light up the sky but no terrorist was found, the sources said.  Security officials said the terrorists melted into darkness.  However, it was found that BSF constables Nitin and Pulwinder were injured in the firing and they were rushed to the hospital in Srinagar. Nitin later succumbed to his injuries.  It was not immediately known whether the BSF personnel was killed by the terrorists or had fallen victim to 'friendly fire' as all security establishments have been directed to be on a high alert after the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes on launch pads across the Line of Control on September 29.  Udhampur-based Northern Command had tweeted a little after midnight only that ""Baramulla incident situation contained and under control"".  Surprisingly, home ministry spokesman had claimed in the morning that two terrorists had been shot dead but this was corroborated neither by the Army, BSF or the local police.  The spokesman later said that the report of the killing of two terrorists was a ""claim"" and it was being ""verified"".  BSF Inspector General (Kashmir) Vikash Chandra said that at least two terrorists were involved in the attack and the security forces recovered a GPS set, a compass and a wire cutter besides some ammunition on Monday morning after a search was launched near the camp on the banks of the Jhelum river.  ""My boys from the spot have confirmed that there were at least two terrorists who were firing at them. There could be few more terrorists, may be two more, but that is not confirmed as of now,"" he said.  Chandra said the firing started about 10.30pm on Sunday night after the BSF men detected some ""suspicious movement"" in the vicinity of their camp that they shared with the 46 Rashtriya Rifles of the Army.  ""Our camp is co-located with the RR. The boys on sentry duty detected suspicious movements and when fire came in they came out of the bunker to effectively take on the terrorists,"" he said, and claimed that Nitin was grievously injured when a grenade lobbed by terrorists hit him.  According to Chandra, the terrorists melted into the darkness and a search operation is on.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/baramulla-attack-how-the-firing-started-at-the-army-bsf-camp/articleshow/54659629.cms","Mon, 03 Oct 2016 13:45:51 GMT","NA","Not Applibale"," Baramulla attack: How the firing started at the Army-BSF camp.

"Prove that surgical strikes really took place & Pakistan is lying: Kejriwal to PM Modi","NEW DELHI: In the wake of Pakistan casting doubts on last week's surgical strikes across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""expose the false propaganda"" being spread by Islamabad on the issue.  He also said that he salutes the Prime Minister for taking strict measures against Pakistan.  ""Recently they (Pakistan) took a delegation of International media to Pakistan and told them that there was no surgical strike at all by the Indian forces. They are spreading a false propaganda. Modi-ji should expose the false propaganda of Pakistan,"" said Kejriwal in a video message.  ""We fully support the PM on surgical strikes. Urge him to similarly counter Pakistan's dirty propaganda. I salute Prime Minister Narendra Modi-ji.""  Last week, India said it had launched surgical strikes on terrorist launch pads across the LoC in the wake of the Uri terror attack.

"  Independent directors in real estate developers press exit buttons on RERA fear","MUMBAI: Fearing that the new Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act (RERA) could land them in trouble, many independent directors are resigning from the boards of real estate developers; and worse few are willing to replace them. The fear is that under RERA, independent directors can be held accountable in case a company fails to comply with the new regulations that are quite stringent.   The way RERA reads today, many independent directors will have a liability in case the developer is unable to follow the regulatory guidelines. The increased liability of the independent director is also causing many people to stay away from real estate boards,  said Rajesh Narain Gupta, managing partner at law firm SNG & Partners. According to data compiled by Prime Database, about 33 independent directors resigned from the listed real estate companies since April this year. Of these, about 22 have resigned since August 1, when clarity around RERA emerged. Going ahead industry experts expect more independent directors to step down.  A person who recently quit as an independent director in an unlisted Mumbai-based realty company told ET:  I didn t quite know what exactly was happening in the company; it was very opaque structure. Going ahead, this could be a huge risk. The promoters weren t very happy, but it wasn t worth the risk,  he said. The Indian real estate sector has a long history of delayed projects, poor quality and illegal construction. A recent research report by real estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) said about 25% of the housing projects are delayed across India. The inventory of residential stock is more than 14-15 months, it said. Even the big organised players are fighting several lawsuits filed by disappointed homebuyers. RERA is aimed at keeping irregularities in the sector under control and is set to provide afillip to the overall real estate funding environment, said experts.  A developer would be required to take disciplined approach for project execution and the same should reflect in the investment agreements by any private equity investor. Experts said a bigger problem is with unlisted players where irregularities may be comparatively more than the listed players.  Many fear that that RERA combined with the Companies Act would unsettle independent directors on board of several real estate firms across the country, leading to several such people stepping down over the next six months. Industry trackers say that the first to resign would be directors in loss-making companies, where the directors' income is impacted because of the inability to earn compensation on profits. This also comes at a time when private equity funds and strategic investors in the real estate sector are looking to include their rights in the investment documents to avoid liability arising out of non-performance.  Many such investors who have invested mainly at project level are renegotiating their contracts with the developers, fearing litigation and fines once the new real estate regulations come in to force.  The fear is that under RERA they can be labelled as developer and may have to face strict penalties for any violation of rules by the projects they fund.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/independent-directors-in-real-estate-developers-boards-press-exit-buttons-on-rera-fear/articleshow/54574616.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 23:48:45 GMT","NA","Not Applibale"," Independent directors in real estate developers boards press exit buttons on RERA fear.

"CoalMin asks MoEF to expedite green nod to CIL washeries","NEW DELHI: The Ministry of Coal has asked the Environment Ministry to expedite the process of green clearances to state-owned CIL washeries so that the company can provide quality coal to its customers.  In a meeting last month, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal requested Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Anil Madhav Dave to hasten the process of green nod to washeries, an official said.  The government had earlier said that challenge is not quantity but quality of the fossil fuel. Setting up washeries at faster rate will hasten the coal washing process and provide quality coal to CIL customers.  The official further said that during the meeting, the coal ministry brought to the notice of Dave the forest area issue with regard to one to two washeries.  Coal washing is a process of separation mainly based on difference in specific gravity of coal and associated impurities like shale, sand and stones to get relatively pure marketable coal without changing its physical properties.  The country has 15 washeries with a capacity of 38 million tonnes per annum.  The Coal Ministry had earlier this year informed a Parliamentary panel that it will establish 15 coal washeries, which will be made operational by September next year.  These washeries will be built in two phases on Build-own -Maintain and EPC contract on turnkey basis.  Regarding new initiatives taken for quality improvement of coal, the members were informed that from January 1, 2016, it has been made mandatory to supply 100 per cent crushed coal of (-) 100 mm size to power sector consumers having fuel supply agreement (FSA) excluding pit-head power plants of Northern Coalfields (NCL) and Eastern Coalfields (ECL)","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/coal-min-asks-moef-to-expedite-green-nod-to-cil-washeries/articleshow/54658617.cms","Mon, 03 Oct 2016 12:46:44 GMT","NA","Not Applibale"," Coal Min asks MoEF to expedite green nod to CIL washeries.

"Nifty forms  Long White Day  on charts; 8,800 big hurdle","NEW DELHI: The bulls finally made a comeback on Dalal Street as the Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial psychological level of 8,700 on Monday.  The index formed a  Long White Day  kind of pattern on the daily candlestick chart, but the 8,800 level on the Nifty50 will act as a stiff resistance.  The index came within kissing distance of the 8,750 mark, but managed to close above its 50-day EMA placed at 8,653, which is a bullish sign.  A  Long White Day  on the daily charts and the crossing of the 8,700 level on a closing basis are positive signs for the bulls. If the momentum continues, the index will be on track to hit its next logical target of 8,800, but could face selling pressure, experts said.  A  Long White Day  signifies that the market witnessed sustained buying interest from the bulls for most part of the day, which is a bullish sign.  Traders should wait for the index to close decisively above its crucial resistance level of 8,800 to create fresh long positions. Exiting long positions should be held with a stop loss at 8,550.  The Nifty50 opened at 8,666 and rose to an intraday high of 8,745, which made a small upper shadow. It slipped over 30 points from its opening level to 8,635 before closing at 8,738.   It was heartening to see the bulls in action as they have built on their gains after a strong opening, which resulted in a  Long White Day  kind of formation on the technical charts. The bulls  domination continued throughout the session,  Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist - Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, told ETMarkets.com.   However, they are likely to encounter huge selling pressure around Thursday s high of 8,800. Once these supplies are completely absorbed by the market, it shall signal the end of the correction at the recent low 8,550 and further strengthen the bullish sentiment,  he said.  Mohammad said any dip in Tuesday s session owing to RBI s money policy can be utilised to create long positions as the probability of the Nifty50 forming a durable bottom around the recent low of 8,550 is much higher.    A strong handover from the US market and strong manufacturing PMI data fuelled momentum in the market ahead of the Reserve Bank of India s (RBI) policy review on Tuesday.   The market is still trading below its key resistance level at 8,800 and one should wait for a close above this level before coming to a conclusion if the market will resume its long-term uptrend after the correction,  Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research, told ETMarkets.com.   After the big fall last week, the Nifty50 has formed a relatively large range candlestick pattern on its daily time series chart with small shadows on both sides. The positive close indicates the dominance of the bulls from the beginning of the session till the end,  he said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tech-view-nifty50-forms-long-white-day-on-charts-8800-level-a-big-hurdle/articleshow/54657574.cms","Mon, 03 Oct 2016 11:42:23 GMT","NA","Not Applibale"," Tech view: Nifty50 forms  Long White Day  on charts; 8,800 level a big hurdle.

"Why Hybrid Cloud solutions are best suited for Indian enterprises","NEW DELHI: As enterprises the world over aim for a secured and faster Cloud experience, Hybrid Cloud solutions are turning out to be the preferred choice for them including in India for enhanced efficiency and productivity and improved cyber security, top executives have said.  A Hybrid Cloud is an integrated Cloud service utilising both private and public Clouds to perform distinct functions within the same organisation.  Enterprises the world over are moving to Hybrid Cloud faster than anyone expected to support digital transformation, drive business model innovation and fuel growth and Indian firms are not behind.  According to a latest report by Pune-based research firm MarketsandMarkets, the global Hybrid Cloud market is estimated to grow from $33.28 billion in 2016 to $91.74 billion by 2021.  ""Hybrid Cloud solutions give you best of both the worlds. It gives you the flexibility of a private server along with the advantages of public Cloud,"" said Shashank Dixit, Founder and CEO of Deskera, a leading Cloud-based business software provider in the Asia-Pacific region.  ""With the kind of talent and technology that we have in India and the demand for end-point security becoming a high priority, I can say that we are getting safer than before and we are moving towards more secured systems,"" Dixit told IANS.  A recent IBM study found that the top reasons executives cite for adopting Hybrid Cloud solutions are: lowering total cost of ownership (54 percent), facilitating innovation (42 percent), enhancing operational efficiencies (42 percent) and enabling them to more readily meet customer expectations (40 percent).  ""Hybrid integration is the next stage in cloud adoption in India like other countries. Hybrid Cloud can help improve an organisation's operations by means of greater agility and speed, more effective reallocation of internal resources and better linkage between business and IT departments,"" said Vivek Malhotra, Cloud Leader, IBM India/South Asia.  Companies undertaking Hybrid Cloud initiatives found that these allowed them to expand into new industries (76 percent), create new revenue sources (71 percent) and create, support new business models (69 percent), revealed the study by the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) based on in-person interviews and surveys of more than 1,000 C-suite executives from 18 industries.  ""As clients continue to reap the benefits of integrating their on-premises infrastructure with the Cloud, we see them increasing their investments in new workloads on public Clouds,"" noted Marie Wieck, IBM, in the study.  Today, Microsoft, Dell-EMC, Hewlett-Packet Enterprise (HPE), Amazon Web Services and several others are trying to get a bigger pie of the growing Hybrid Cloud market.  With the right set of compliance standards, secure connectivity, firewalls and gateways deployed, Cloud is just a secure extension to the on-premise deployment.  ""It is also imperative to select cloud vendors with security and compliance focus and expertise. Cloud data centres located in the country will boost data security. It is essential that the public cloud vendors should comply with security compliance standards and be thoroughly audited by third party security organisations rather than in-house claims,"" Malhotra told IANS.  Are Hybrid Cloud solutions safe in India?  ""Properly architected Hybrid Cloud architectures are as safe and secure as any other option available to Chief information officers (CIOs). The important dimension is to weave in the security strategy at the point of genesis and ensure that it is holistic in its construct, covering all layers as well as data,"" Jaideep Mehta, Managing Director, International Data Corporation (IDC) South Asia, told IANS.  ""Today, data security is paramount in India. Deskera has years of experience in ensuring data security on the Cloud. We believe we have the right technology needed for deploying secured business applications on the Cloud for Indian businesses and state governments,"" Dixit said.  According to Malhotra, IBM works with independent auditors and third-party organisations to meet the industry's most stringent guidelines to provide reports and information required for client's compliance needs for the Hybrid Cloud experience.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/why-hybrid-cloud-solutions-are-best-suited-for-indian-enterprises/articleshow/54651523.cms","Mon, 03 Oct 2016 05:52:06 GMT","NA","Not Applibale"," Why Hybrid Cloud solutions are best suited for Indian enterprises.
