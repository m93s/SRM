943,Normally long- term finance such as equity and debt consist of fixed cost while mobilization.
944,"When  the  cost  of  capital  increases,  value  of  the  firm  will  also  decrease."
945,Hence  the  firm must take careful steps to reduce the cost of capital.
946,(a) Nature  of  the  business: Use of fixed interest/dividend bearing finance depends upon  the  nature  of  the  business.
947,"If  the  business  consists  of  long  period  of operation, it will apply for equity than debt, and it will reduce the cost of capital."

1245,INTRODUCTION Cost of capital is an integral part of investment decision as it is used to measure the worth of investment proposal provided by the business concern.
1246,It is used as a discount rate in determining the present value of future cash flows associated with capital projects.
1247,"Cost of capital  is  also  called  as  cut-off  rate,  target  rate,  hurdle  rate  and  required  rate  of  return."
1248,"When  the  firms  are  using  different  sources  of  finance,  the  finance  manager  must  take careful decision with regard to the cost of capital; because it is closely associated with the value of the firm and the earning capacity of the firm."
1249,Meaning of Cost of Capital Cost  of  capital  is  the  rate  of  return  that  a  firm  must  earn  on  its  project  investments  to maintain its market value and attract funds.
1250,"Cost of capital is the required rate of return on its investments which belongs to equity, debt and retained earnings."
1251,"If a firm fails to earn return at the expected rate, the market value  of  the  shares  will  fall  and  it  will  result  in  the  reduction  of  overall  wealth  of  the shareholders."
1252,Definitions The following important definitions are commonly used to understand the meaning and concept of the cost of capital.
1253,According to the definition of John J. Hampton     Cost of capital is the rate of return the firm required from investment in order to increase the value of the firm in the market place   .
1254,"According to the definition of Solomon Ezra,    Cost of capital is the minimum required  rate of earnings or the cut-off rate of capital expenditure   ."
1255,"66  Financial Management  According to the definition of James C. Van Horne, Cost of capital is    A cut-off rate for the allocation of capital to investment of projects."
1256,It is the rate of return on a project that will leave unchanged the market price of the stock   .
1257,"According to the definition of William and Donaldson,    Cost of capital may be defined as  the  rate  that  must  be  earned  on  the  net  proceeds  to  provide  the  cost  elements  of  the burden at the time they are due   ."
1258,Assumption of Cost of Capital Cost of capital is based on certain assumptions which are closely associated while calculating and measuring the cost of capital.
1259,It is to be considered that there are three basic concepts:  1.
1260,It is not a cost as such.
1261,It is merely a hurdle rate.
1262,2.
1263,It is the minimum rate of return.
1264,3.
1265,"It consis of three important risks such as zero risk level, business risk and financial risk."
1266,Cost of capital can be measured with the help of the following equation.
1267,"Where,  K = rj + b + f.  K = Cost of capital."
1268,rj = The riskless cost of the particular type of finance.
1269,b = The business risk premium.
1270,f = The financial risk premium.
1271,CLASSIFICATION OF COST OF CAPITAL Cost of capital may be classified into the following types on the basis of nature and usage:  (cid:127) Explicit and Implicit Cost.
1272,(cid:127) Average and Marginal Cost.
1273,(cid:127) Historical and Future Cost.
1274,(cid:127) Specific and Combined Cost.
1275,Explicit and Implicit Cost The cost of capital may be explicit or implicit cost on the basis of the computation of cost of capital.
1276,Explicit cost is the rate that the firm pays to procure financing.
1277,"This may be calculated  with the help of the following equation;  CO  +   n  t t (t C)  CIo =  = t 1  Where,  CIo = initial cash inflow  C = outflow in the period concerned  Cost of Captial  67  N = duration for which the funds are provided T = tax rate  Implicit cost is the rate of return associated with the best investment opportunity for the  firm  and  its  shareholders  that  will  be  forgone  if  the  projects  presently  under consideration by the firm were accepted."
1278,Average and Marginal Cost Average cost of capital is the weighted average cost of each component of capital employed by the company.
1279,"It considers weighted average cost of all kinds of financing such as equity, debt, retained earnings etc."
1280,Marginal cost is the weighted average cost of new finance raised by the company.
1281,It is  the additional cost of capital when the company goes for further raising of finance.
1282,Historical and Future Cost Historical cost is the cost which as already been incurred for financing a particular project.
1283,It is based on the actual cost incurred in the previous project.
1284,Future cost is the expected cost of financing in the proposed project.
1285,Expected cost is  calculated on the basis of previous experience.
1286,"Specific and Combine Cost The cost of each sources of capital such as equity, debt, retained earnings and loans is called as specific cost of capital."
1287,It is very useful to determine the each and every specific source of capital.
1288,The composite or combined cost of capital is the combination of all sources of capital.
1289,It is also called as overall cost of capital.
1290,It is used to understand the total cost associated with the total finance of the firm.
1291,IMPORTANCE OF COST OF CAPITAL Computation  of  cost  of  capital  is  a  very  important  part  of  the  financial  management  to decide the capital structure of the business concern.
1292,Importance to Capital Budgeting Decision Capital budget decision largely depends on the cost of capital of each source.
1293,"According to net  present  value  method,  present  value  of  cash  inflow  must  be  more  than  the  present value of cash outflow."
1294,"Hence, cost of capital is used to capital budgeting decision."
1295,Importance to Structure Decision Capital  structure  is  the  mix  or  proportion  of  the  different  kinds  of  long  term  securities.
1296,A firm uses particular type of sources if the cost of capital is suitable.
1297,"Hence, cost of capital helps to take decision regarding structure."
1298,"68  Financial Management  Importance to Evolution of Financial Performance Cost of capital is one of the important determine which affects the capital budgeting, capital structure and value of the firm."
1299,"Hence, it helps to evaluate the financial performance of the firm."
1300,"Importance to Other Financial Decisions Apart from the above points, cost of capital is also used in some other areas such as, market value of share, earning capacity of securities etc."
1301,"hence, it plays a major part in the financial management."
1302,COMPUTATION OF COST OF CAPITAL Computation of cost of capital consists of two important parts:  1.
1303,Measurement of specific costs 2.
1304,Measurement of overall cost of capital  Measurement of Cost of Capital It refers to the cost of each specific sources of finance like:  (cid:127) Cost of equity (cid:127) Cost of debt (cid:127) Cost of preference share (cid:127) Cost of retained earnings  Cost of Equity Cost of equity capital is the rate at which investors discount the expected dividends of the firm to determine its share value.
1305,Conceptually  the  cost  of  equity  capital  (Ke)  defined  as  the     Minimum  rate  of  return that a firm must earn on the equity financed portion of an investment project in order to leave unchanged the market price of the shares   .
1306,Cost of equity can be calculated from the following approach: (cid:127) Dividend  price  (D/P)  approach (cid:127) Dividend price plus growth (D/P + g) approach (cid:127) Earning price (E/P) approach (cid:127) Realized yield approach.
1307,Dividend Price Approach The cost of equity capital will be that rate of expected dividend which will maintain the present market price of equity shares.
1308,"Dividend price approach can be measured with the help of the following formula:  K =  e  D N  p  Cost of Captial  Where,  Ke = Cost of equity capital D   = Dividend per equity share Np = Net proceeds of an equity share  69   Exercise 1 A  company  issues  10,000  equity  shares  of  Rs."
1309,100  each  at  a  premium  of  10%.
1310,The company has been paying 25% dividend to equity shareholders for the past five years and expects to maintain the same in the future also.
1311,Compute the cost of equity capital.

1316,=  K  e  D N  p  =  25 175      100  = 14.28%  Dividend Price Plus Growth Approach The cost of equity is calculated on the basis of the expected dividend rate per share plus growth in dividend.
1317,"It can be measured with the help of the following formula:  =  K  e  +  g  D N  p  Where,   Ke = Cost of equity capital D   = Dividend per equity share  g   = Growth in expected dividend Np = Net proceeds of an equity share  Exercise  2 (a) A  company  plans  to  issue  10000  new  shares  of  Rs."

1335,It is based on the future earning prospects  of  the  equity.
1336,The  formula  for  calculating  the  cost  of  equity  according  to  this approach is as follows.
1337,"=  K  e  E N  p  Where,  Ke = Cost of equity capital E = Earning per share Np = Net proceeds of an equity share  Cost of Captial  71  Exercise  4 A  firm  is  considering  an  expenditure  of  Rs."

1891,The following are the major criticisms of MM  approach.
1892,Dividend Decision  107  MM approach assumes that tax does not exist.
1893,It is not applicable in the practical life of  the firm.
1894,"MM approach assumes that, there is no risk and uncertain of the investment."
1895,It is also  not applicable in present day business life.
1896,MM approach does not consider floatation cost and transaction cost.
1897,It leads to affect  the value of the firm.
1898,"MM approach considers only single decrement rate, it does not exist in real practice."
1899,"MM approach assumes that, investor behaves rationally."
1900,But we cannot give assurance  that all the investors will behave rationally.
1901,"RELEVANCE OF DIVIDEND According  to  this  concept,  dividend  policy  is  considered  to  affect  the  value  of  the  firm."
1902,Dividend relevance implies that shareholders prefer current dividend and there is no direct relationship between dividend policy and value of the firm.
1903,Relevance of dividend concept is supported by two eminent persons like Walter and Gordon.
1904,Walter   s Model Prof. James E. Walter argues that the dividend policy almost always affects the value of the firm.
1905,"Walter model is based in the relationship between the following important factors: (cid:127) Rate  of  return  I (cid:127) Cost  of  capital  (k) According to the Walter   s model, if  r > k, the firm is able to earn more than what the shareholders  could  by  reinvesting,  if  the  earnings  are  paid  to  them."
1906,The  implication  of r > k is that the shareholders can earn a higher return by investing elsewhere.
1907,"If  the  firm  has  r  =  k,  it  is  a  matter  of  indifferent  whether  earnings  are  retained  or  distributed."
1908,Assumptions Walters model is based on the following important assumptions:  1.
1909,The  firm  uses  only  internal  finance.
1910,2.
1911,The  firm  does  not  use  debt  or  equity  finance.
1912,3.
1913,The  firm  has  constant  return  and  cost  of  capital.
1914,4.
1915,The  firm  has  100  recent  payout.
1916,5.
1917,The  firm  has  constant  EPS  and  dividend.
1918,6.
1919,Walter has evolved a mathematical formula for determining the value of market share.
1920,The  firm  has  a  very  long  life.

1934,"12.5  Dividend  Payout =  =  DPS  EPS   100 5 10   100 = 60%  r >Ke therefore by distributing 60% of earnings, the firm is not following an optional dividend policy."
1935,"In this case, the optional dividend policy for the firm would be to pay zero dividend and the Market Price would be:  P =  5+.15/.10  (10  0)  .10  =  =  5 + 15  .10  20 .10  P = Rs."
1936,"200  So, the MP of the share can be increased by following a zero payout, of the P/E is 7.25 instead of 10 then the Ke =1=0.138 and in this case Ke>r and the MP of the share is 7.25."

1951,81.48  Criticism of Walter   s Model The following are some of the important criticisms against Walter model:  Walter model assumes that there is no extracted finance used by the firm.
1952,It is not  practically  applicable.
1953,There is no possibility of constant return.
1954,"Return may increase or decrease, depending  upon the business situation."
1955,"Hence, it is applicable."
1956,"According to Walter model, it is based on constant cost of capital."
1957,But it is not applicable  in the real life of the business.
1958,"Gordon   s Model Myron Gorden suggest one of the popular model which assume that dividend policy of a firm affects its value, and it is based on the following important assumptions:  1."
1959,The  firm  is  an  all  equity  firm.

1997,FACTORS  DETERMINING  DIVIDEND  POLICY  Profitable Position of the Firm Dividend decision depends on the profitable position of the business concern.
1998,"When the firm earns more profit, they can distribute more dividends to the shareholders."
1999,"Uncertainty of Future Income Future  income  is  a  very  important  factor,  which  affects  the  dividend  policy."
2000,"When  the shareholder needs regular income, the firm should maintain regular dividend policy."
2001,Legal Constrains The Companies Act 1956 has put several restrictions regarding payments and declaration of dividends.
2002,"Similarly, Income Tax Act, 1961 also lays down certain restrictions on payment of dividends."
2003,Liquidity Position Liquidity position of the firms leads to easy payments of dividend.
2004,"If the firms have high liquidity, the firms can provide cash dividend otherwise, they have to pay stock dividend."
2005,"Sources of Finance If the firm has finance sources, it will be easy to mobilise large finance."
2006,The firm shall not go for retained earnings.
2007,Growth Rate of the Firm High growth rate implies that the firm can distribute more dividend to its shareholders.
2008,Tax Policy Tax  policy  of  the  government  also  affects  the  dividend  policy  of  the  firm.
2009,"When  the government gives tax  incentives, the company pays more dividend."

2014,Regular Dividend Policy Dividend payable at the usual rate is called as regular dividend policy.
2015,"This type of policy is suitable to the small investors, retired persons and others."
2016,Stable Dividend Policy Stable dividend policy means payment of certain minimum amount of dividend regularly.
2017,This dividend policy consists of the following three important forms:  Constant dividend per share Constant  payout  ratio Stable rupee dividend plus extra dividend.
2018,"Irregular Dividend Policy When the companies are facing constraints of earnings and unsuccessful business operation, they may follow irregular dividend policy."

2088,According to the definition of G.C.
2089,"Philippatos,    capital budgeting is concerned with the  allocation  of  the  firms  source  financial  resources  among  the  available  opportunities."
2090,"The  consideration  of  investment  opportunities  involves  the  comparison  of  the  expected future streams of earnings from a project with the immediate and subsequent streams of earning from a project, with the immediate and subsequent streams of expenditure   ."
2091,"According to the definition of Richard and Green law,    capital budgeting is acquiring  inputs with long-term return   ."
2092,"According  to  the  definition  of  Lyrich,     capital  budgeting  consists  in  planning development of available capital for the purpose of maximizing the long-term profitability of  the  concern   ."
2093,120  Financial Management  It is clearly explained in the above definitions that a firm   s scarce financial resources are utilizing the available opportunities.
2094,The overall objectives of the company from is to maximize the profits and minimize the expenditure of cost.
2095,Need and Importance of Capital Budgeting  1.
2096,"Huge  investments:  Capital  budgeting  requires  huge  investments  of  funds,  but the available funds are limited, therefore the firm before investing projects, plan are  control  its  capital  expenditure."
2097,2.
2098,Long-term:  Capital  expenditure  is  long-term  in  nature  or  permanent  in  nature.
2099,Therefore financial risks involved in the investment decision are more.
2100,"If higher risks  are  involved,  it  needs  careful  planning  of  capital  budgeting."
2101,3.
2102,"Irreversible:  The  capital  investment  decisions  are  irreversible,  are  not  changed back."
2103,"Once  the  decision  is  taken  for  purchasing  a  permanent  asset,  it  is  very difficult  to  dispose  off  those  assets  without  involving  huge  losses."
2104,4.
2105,Long-term effect: Capital budgeting not only reduces the cost but also increases the  revenue  in  long-term  and  will  bring  significant  changes  in  the  profit  of  the company  by  avoiding  over  or  more  investment  or  under  investment.
2106,Over investments leads to be unable to utilize assets or over utilization of fixed assets.
2107,"Therefore  before  making  the  investment,  it  is  required  carefully  planning  and analysis  of  the  project  thoroughly."
2108,CAPITAL  BUDGETING  PROCESS Capital   budgeting is a difficult process to the investment of available funds.
2109,"The benefit will attained only in the near future but, the future is uncertain."
2110,"However, the following steps  followed for capital budgeting, then the process may be easier are."

2112,9.1 Capital Budgeting Process  Capital Budgeting  121  1.
2113,Identification  of  various  investments  proposals:  The  capital  budgeting  may have various investment proposals.
2114,The proposal for the investment opportunities may  be  defined  from  the  top  management  or  may  be  even  from  the  lower  rank.
2115,"The  heads  of  various  department  analyse  the  various  investment  decisions,  and will select proposals submitted to the planning committee of competent authority."
2116,2.
2117,Screening or matching the proposals: The planning committee will analyse the various proposals and screenings.
2118,The selected proposals are considered with the available  resources  of  the  concern.
2119,Here  resources  referred  as  the  financial  part of  the  proposal.
2120,This  reduces  the  gap  between  the  resources  and  the  investment cost.
2121,Independent  proposals  3.
2122,"Evaluation: After screening, the proposals are evaluated with the help of various methods,  such as pay back period proposal, net discovered present value method, accounting  rate  of  return  and  risk  analysis."
2123,Each  method  of  evaluation  used  in detail  in  the  later  part  of  this  chapter.
2124,The  proposals  are  evaluated  by.
2125,(a) (b) Contingent  of  dependent  proposals (c) Partially  exclusive  proposals.
2126,Independent  proposals  are  not  compared  with  another  proposals  and  the  same may be accepted or rejected.
2127,Whereas higher proposals acceptance depends upon the other one or more proposals.
2128,"For example, the expansion of plant machinery leads to constructing of new building, additional manpower etc."
2129,"Mutually exclusive projects  are  those  which  competed  with  other  proposals  and  to  implement  the proposals  after  considering  the  risk  and  return,  market  demand  etc."
2130,4.
2131,"Fixing property:  After the evolution, the planning committee will predict which proposals  will  give  more  profit  or  economic  consideration."
2132,"If  the  projects  or proposals  are  not  suitable  for  the  concern   s  financial  condition,  the  projects  are rejected  without  considering  other  nature  of  the  proposals."
2133,5.
2134,"Final  approval:  The  planning  committee  approves  the  final  proposals,  with  the  help  of  the  following: (a) Profitability (b) Economic  constituents (c) Financial  violability (d) Market  conditions."
2135,The  planning  committee  prepares  the  cost  estimation  and  submits  to  the management.
2136,6.
2137,Implementing:  The  competent  autherity  spends  the  money  and  implements  the proposals.
2138,"While implementing the proposals, assign responsibilities to the proposals, assign responsibilities for completing it, within the time allotted and reduce the cost for  this  purpose."
2139,The  network  techniques  used  such  as  PERT  and  CPM.
2140,It  helps the management for monitoring and containing the implementation of the proposals.
2141,122  Financial Management  7.
2142,Performance review of feedback:  The final stage of capital budgeting is actual results compared with the standard results.
2143,The adverse or unfavourable results identified and removing the various difficulties of the project.
2144,This is helpful for the  future  of  the  proposals.
2145,KINDS OF CAPITAL BUDGETING DECISIONS The  overall  objective  of  capital  budgeting  is  to  maximize  the  profitability.
2146,"If  a  firm concentrates return on investment, this objective can be achieved either by increasing the revenues or reducing the costs."
2147,The increasing revenues can be achieved by expansion or the  size  of  operations  by  adding  a  new  product  line.
2148,Reducing  costs  mean  representing obsolete return on assets.
2149,METHODS OF CAPITAL BUDGETING OF EVALUATION By matching the available resources and projects it can be invested.
2150,The funds available are  always  living  funds.
2151,There  are  many  considerations  taken  for  investment  decision process such as environment and economic conditions.
2152,The methods of evaluations are classified as follows:  (A) Traditional  methods  (or  Non-discount  methods)  Pay-back  Period  Methods Post  Pay-back  Methods  (i) (ii) (iii) Accounts  Rate  of  Return  (B) Modern  methods  (or  Discount  methods)  (i) Net  Present  Value  Method (ii) (iii)  Internal  Rate  of  Return  Method Profitability  Index  Method  Methods of Capital Budgeting  Traditional   Method  Modern  Methods  Pay-back  Method   Post pay-back  Method   Accounting  Rate of Return  Net present  Value Method  Internal Rate  of Return Method  Profitability  Index Method  Fig.

2155,Pay-back period =   Initial investment   Annual cash inflows  Merits of Pay-back method  The following are the important merits of the pay-back method:  It  is  easy  to  calculate  and  simple  to  understand.
2156,1.
2157,2.
2158,Pay-back  method  provides  further  improvement  over  the  accounting  rate  return.
2159,3.
2160,Pay-back  method  reduces  the  possibility  of  loss  on  account  of  obsolescence.
2161,Demerits  1.

2163,3.
2164,It  ignores  the  time  value  of  money.
2165,It  ignores  all  cash  inflows  after  the  pay-back  period.
2166,It  is  one  of  the  misleading  evaluations  of  capital  budgeting.
2167,"Accept /Reject criteria If the actual pay-back period is less than the predetermined pay-back period, the project would be accepted."
2168,"If not, it would be rejected."

2175,"10,000   = 3 Years  The annual cash inflow is calculated by considering the amount of net income on the amount  of  depreciation  project  (Asset)  before  taxation  but  after  taxation."
2176,"The  income precision earned is expressed as a percentage of initial investment, is called unadjusted rate of return."
2177,The above problem will be calculated as below:  Unadjusted rate of return =  Annual Return  Investment      100  =  Rs.

2203,Post Pay-back Profitability Method One of the major limitations of pay-back period method is that it does not consider the cash inflows earned after pay-back period and if the real profitability of the project cannot be assessed.
2204,"To improve over this method, it can be made by considering the receivable after the pay-back period."

2349,Therefore  project    A    is preferable.
2350,Exercise  10 A project costs Rs.
2351,"16,000 and is expected to generate cash inflows of Rs."
2352,"4,000 each 5  years."

2366,The project has selected the combination of proposal that will yield the greatest  portability.
2367,Exercise 12   Let us assume that a firm has only Rs.
2368,20 lakhs to invest and funds cannot be provided.
2369,The various proposals along with the cost and profitability index are as follows.
2370,"Proposal  Pool of the project  Profitability Index  1 2 3 4 5  6,00,000 2,00,000 10,00,000 4,00,000 3,00,000  1.46 .098 2.31 1.32 1.25  136  Financial Management  Solution In this example all proposals expect number 2 give profitability exceeding one and are profitable  investments."
2371,The  total  outlay  required  to  be  invested    in  all  other  (profitable) project is Rs.
2372,"25,00,000(1+2+3+4+5) but total funds available with the firm are Rs."
2373,20 lakhs and hence the firm has to do capital combination of project within a total which has the lowest profitability index along with the profitable proposals cannot be taken.
2374,RISK AND UNCERTAINLY IN CAPITAL BUDGETING  Capital  budgeting  requires  the  projection  of  cash  inflow  and  outflow  of  the  future.
2375,"The  future  in  always  uncertain,  estimate  of  demand,  production,  selling  price,  cost  etc., cannot  be  exact."
2376,"For  example:  The  product  at  any  time  it  become  obsolete  therefore,    the  future  in unexpected."
2377,The following methods for considering the accounting of risk in capital budgeting.
2378,Various evaluation methods are used for risk and uncertainty in capital budgeting are as follows:  (i) Risk-adjusted  cut  off  rate  (or  method  of  varying  discount  rate) (ii) Certainly  equivalent  method.
2379,(iii) Sensitivity  technique.
2380,(iv) Probability  technique (v) Standard  deviation  method.
2381,(vi) Co-efficient  of  variation  method.
2382,(vii) Decision  tree  analysis.
2383,(i) Risk-adjusted  cutoff  rate  (or  Method  of  varying)  This is one of the simplest method while calculating the risk in capital budgeting increase  cut  of  rate  or  discount  factor  by  certain  percentage  an  account  of  risk.
2384,"Exercise 13 The Ramakrishna Ltd., in considering the purchase of a new investment."
2385,Two alternative investments are available (X and Y) each costing  Rs.
2386,150000.
2387,Cash inflows are expected to be as follows:  Year     1    2    3    4  Cash Inflows  Investment X  Rs.

2390,Risk premium rate are 2% and  8% respectively for investment X and Y.
2391,Which investment should be preferred?
2392,Capital Budgeting  137  Solution The profitability of the two investments can be compared on the basis of net present  values cash inflows adjusted for risk premium rates as follows:  Investment X  Discount Cash Factor10% + 2% Inflow = 12%  Rs.
2393,"0.893 0.797 0.712 0.635  60,000 45,000 35,000 30,000  Year  1 2 3 4  Investment Y  Discount Factor 10% + 8%=18% 0.847 0.718 0.609 0.516  Cash Inflow Rs."

2396,16585  Investment Y Net present value  = 156485     150000  = Rs.
2397,"6485  As  even  at  a  higher  discount  rate  investment  Y  gives  a  higher  net  present  value,  investment Y should be preferred."
2398,(ii) Certainly  equivalent  method  It  is  also  another  simplest  method  for  calculating  risk  in  capital  budgeting  info reduceds  expected  cash  inflows  by  certain  amounts  it  can  be  employed  by multiplying the expected cash inflows by certainly equivalent co-efficient in order the  uncertain  cash  inflow  to  certain  cash  inflows.
2399,Exercise  14  There  are  two  projects  A  and  B.
2400,Each  involves  an  investment  of  Rs.

2410,"These inflows may be regarded on     Optimistic   ,     most  likely     and     pessimistic   ."
2411,Further  cash  inflows  may  be discounted to find out the net present values under these three different situations.
2412,If  the  net  present  values  under  the  three  situations  differ  widely  it  implies  that there is a great risk in the project and the investor   s is decision to accept or reject a  project  will  depend  upon  his  risk  bearing  activities.

2653,The  following are the major factors which are determining the Working Capital requirements.
2654,Factors  Factors  Working  Capital  Determinants  Factors  Fig.
2655,10.7 Factors  Determining Working Capital Requirements  Factors  1.
2656,Nature  of  business:  Working  Capital  of  the  business  concerns  largely  depend upon the nature of the business.
2657,"If the business concerns follow rigid credit policy and sell goods only for cash, they can maintain lesser amount of Working Capital."

2659,2.
2660,Production  cycle:  Amount  of  Working  Capital  depends  upon  the  length  of  the production  cycle.
2661,"If  the  production  cycle  length  is  small,  they  need  to  maintain lesser amount of Working Capital."
2662,"If it is not, they have to maintain large amount of  Working  Capital."
2663,3. Business cycle: Business fluctuations lead to cyclical and seasonal changes in the business condition and it will affect the requirements of the Working Capital.
2664,"In the  booming  conditions,  the  Working  Capital  requirement  is  larger  and  in  the depression condition, requirement of Working Capital will reduce."
2665,Better business results  lead  to  increase  the  Working  Capital  requirements.
2666,4.
2667,Production policy: It is also one of the factors which affects the Working Capital requirement  of  the  business  concern.
2668,"If  the  company  maintains  the  continues production  policy,  there  is  a  need  of  regular  Working  Capital."

2675,7.
2676,Availability of raw materials: Major part of the Working Capital requirements are largely depend on the availability of raw materials.
2677,Raw materials are the basic components of the production process.
2678,"If the raw material is not readily available, it  leads  to  production  stoppage."
2679,"So,  the  concern  must  maintain  adequate  raw material;  for  that  purpose,  they  have  to  spend  some  amount  of  Working  Capital."
2680,8.
2681,"Earning  capacity:  If  the  business  concern  consists  of  high  level  of  earning capacity,  they  can  generate  more  Working  Capital,  with  the  help  of  cash  from operation."
2682,Earning  capacity  is  also  one  of  the  factors  which  determines  the Working  Capital  requirements  of  the  business  concern.
2683,"COMPUTATION (OR ESTIMATION) OF WORKING CAPITAL Working Capital requirement depends upon number of factors, which are already discussed in the previous parts."
2684,Now the discussion is on how to calculate the Working Capital needs of the business concern.
2685,It may also depend upon various factors but some of the common methods are used to estimate the Working Capital.
2686,A. Estimation  of  components  of  working  capital  method  Working  capital  consists  of  various  current  assets  and  current  liabilities.
2687,"Hence, we  have  to  estimate  how  much  current  assets  as  inventories  required  and  how much  cash  required  to  meet  the  short  term  obligations."
2688,Finance  Manager  first  estimates  the  assets  and  required  Working  Capital  for  a particular  period.
2689,B.
2690,"Percent  of  sales  method  Based  on  the  past  experience  between  Sales  and  Working  Capital  requirements,  a ratio can be determined for estimating the Working Capital requirement in future."
2691,It is the simple and tradition method to estimate the Working Capital requirements.
2692,"Under this method, first we have to find out the sales to Working Capital ratio and based on that we have to estimate Working Capital requirements."
2693,This method also expresses  the  relationship  between  the  Sales  and  Working  Capital.
2694,C. Operating  cycle  Working  Capital  requirements  depend  upon  the  operating  cycle  of  the  business.
2695,The  operating  cycle  begins  with  the  acquisition  of  raw  material  and  ends  with the  collection  of  receivables.
2696,Working Capital  157  Operating cycle consists of the following important stages: 1.
2697,"Raw  Material  and  Storage  Stage,  (R) 2."
2698,"Work  in  Process  Stage,  (W) 3."
2699,"Finished  Goods  Stage,  (F) 4."

2727,"External sources such as: (cid:127) Debentures  and  Public  Deposits (cid:127) Loans  from  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions (cid:127) Advances  and  Credit (cid:127) Financial  arrangements  like  Factoring,  etc."
2728,Determining the Finance Mix Determining the finance mix is an important part of working capital management.
2729,"Under this decision, the relationship among risk, return and liquidity are measured and also which type  of  financing  is  suitable  to  meet  the  Working  Capital  requirements  of  the  business concern."
2730,There are three basic approaches for determining an appropriate Working Capital finance mix.
2731,1.
2732,Hedging  or  matching  approach 2.
2733,Conservative  approach 3.
2734,Aggressive  approach.
2735,Hedging  Approach  Hedging  approach  is  also  known  as  matching  approach.
2736,"Under  this  approach,  the business concern can adopt a financial plan which matches the expected life of assets with the expected life of the sources of funds raised to finance assets."
2737,"When the business follows matching approach, long-term finance shall be used to fixed assets  and  permanent  current  assets  and  short-term  financing  to  finance  temporary  or variable assets."

2746,Banks provide finance to business concerns to meet the requirements.
2747,"To regulate and  control  bank  finance,  RBI  constitute  committees."
2748,These  committees  submit  reports with  findings  and  recommendations  to  formulate  the  finance  policy  of  the  banks.
2749,The major committee and the recommendations are as follows:  Committee  DEHEJIA TANDON  CHORE  MARATHE  KANNAN  Year  1969 1975  1980  1984  1997                              Major Recommendations  Appraisal of credit applications received by banks for granting loan.

2765,6.
2766,Explain  the  working  capital  management  policy.
2767,This page  intentionally left  blank  Management of Working Capital is also an important part of financial manager.
2768,The main objective of the Working Capital Management is managing the Current Asset and Current Liabilities effectively and maintaining adequate amount of both Current Asset and Current Liabilities.
2769,Simply it is called Administration of Current Asset and Current Liabilities of the business  concern.
2770,"Management of key components of working capital like cash, inventories and receivables assumes  paramount  importance  due  to  the  fact  the  major  potion  of  working  capital  gets blocked in these assets."
2771,"Meaning Working  capital  management  is  an  act  of  planning,  organizing  and  controlling  the components  of  working  capital  like  cash,  bank  balance  inventory,  receivables,  payables, overdraft and short-term loans."
2772,"Definition According to Smith  K.V,     Working capital management is concerned with the problems that  arise  in  attempting  to  manage  the  current  asset,  current  liabilities  and  the  inter- relationship that exist between them   ."
2773,"According to Weston  and  Brigham,     Working capital generally stands for excess of current assets over current liabilities."
2774,Working capital management therefore refers to all aspects of the administration of both current assets and current liabilities   .
2775,INVENTORY  MANAGEMENT Introduction Inventories constitute the most significant part of current assets of the business concern.
2776,It is also essential for smooth running of the business activities.
2777,"166  Financial Management  A proper planning of purchasing of raw material, handling, storing and recording is to be considered as a part of inventory management."
2778,"Inventory management means, management of  raw  materials  and  related  items."
2779,"Inventory  management  considers  what  to  purchase, how  to  purchase,  how  much  to  purchase,  from  where  to  purchase,  where  to  store  and when to use for production etc."
2780,Meaning The dictionary meaning of the inventory is stock of goods or a list of goods.
2781,"In accounting language,  inventory  means  stock  of  finished  goods."
2782,"In  a  manufacturing  point  of  view, inventory includes, raw material, work in process, stores, etc."
2783,Kinds of Inventories Inventories can be classified into five major categories.
2784,A.
2785,Raw  Material  It is basic and important part of inventories.
2786,These are goods which have not yet been  committed  to  production  in  a  manufacturing  business  concern.
2787,B.
2788,Work  in  Progress  These include those materials which have been committed to production process but  have  not  yet  been  completed.
2789,C. Consumables  These are the materials which are needed to smooth running of the manufacturing process.
2790,D. Finished  Goods  These  are  the  final  output  of  the  production  process  of  the  business  concern.
2791,It is  ready  for  consumers.
2792,"E. Spares  It  is  also  a  part  of  inventories,  which  includes  small  spares  and  parts."
2793,Objectives of Inventory Management Inventory  occupy  30   80%  of  the  total  current  assets  of  the  business  concern.
2794,It  is  also very  essential  part  not  only  in  the  field  of  Financial  Management  but  also  it  is  closely associated with production management.
2795,"Hence, in any working capital decision regarding the inventories, it will affect both financial and production function of the concern."
2796,"Hence, efficient management of inventories is an essential part of any kind of manufacturing process concern."
2797,The major objectives of the inventory management are as follows: (cid:127) To efficient and smooth production process.
2798,(cid:127) To maintain optimum inventory to maximize the profitability.
2799,(cid:127) To meet the seasonal demand of the products.
2800,Working Capital Management  167  (cid:127) To avoid price increase in future.
2801,(cid:127) To ensure the level and site of inventories required.
2802,(cid:127) To plan when to purchase and where to purchase (cid:127) To avoid both over stock and under stock of inventory.
2803,Techniques of  Inventory Management Inventory  management  consists  of  effective  control  and  administration  of  inventories.
2804,Inventory control refers to a system which ensures supply of required quantity and quality of inventories at the required time and at the same time prevent unnecessary investment in inventories.
2805,It needs the following important techniques.
2806,Inventory management techniques may be classified into various types:  Inventory Management Technique  Techniques Based on  Order Quantity  Techniques Based on  the Classification  Techniques Based on  the Records  ABC  Analysis  VED  Analysis  HML  Analysis  Aging  Schedule  Inventory Report  Inventory Budget  Determination of Stock Level  Determination  of Stock  Economic Order   Quality  Fig.
2807,11.1 Inventory Management Techniques  A.
2808,Techniques  based  on  the  order  quantity  of  Inventories  Order  quantity  of  inventories  can  be  determined  with  the  help  of  the  following techniques:  Stock Level Stock level is the level of stock which is maintained by the business concern at all times.
2809,"Therefore, the business concern must maintain optimum level of stock to smooth running of the business process."
2810,Different level of stock can be determined based on the volume of the  stock.
2811,168  Financial Management  Minimum Level The business concern must maintain minimum level of stock at all times.
2812,"If the stocks are less than the minimum level, then the work will stop due to shortage of material."
2813,Re-order Level Re-ordering level is fixed between minimum level and maximum level.
2814,Re-order level is the level when the business concern makes fresh order at this level.
2815,Re-order level=maximum consumption    maximum Re-order period.
2816,"Maximum Level It is the maximum limit of the quantity of inventories, the business concern must maintain."
2817,If the quantity exceeds maximum level limit then it will be overstocking.
2818,Maximum level = Re-order level + Re-order quantity      (Minimum consumption    Minimum delivery period)  Danger Level It is the level below the minimum level.
2819,It leads to stoppage of the production process.
2820,"Maximum re-order period for  Danger level=Average consumption                                 emergency purchase  Average Stock Level It is calculated such as,  Average stock level= Minimum stock level +                                          maximum level      of re-order quantity  75  500  Stock Level  25  10  0  Optimum Level/Re-order Level  Average Stock Level  Minimum Level  Danger Level  Time  Fig."
2821,11.2  Determining the Stock Level  Lead Time Lead time is the time normally taken in receiving delivery after placing orders with suppliers.
2822,The time taken in processing the order and then executing it is known as lead time.
2823,Working Capital Management  169  Safety Stock Safety stock implies extra inventories that can be drawn down when actual lead time and/ or usage rates are greater than expected.
2824,Safety stocks are determined by opportunity cost and  carrying  cost  of  inventories.
2825,"If  the  business  concerns  maintain  low  level  of  safety stock, it will lead to larger opportunity cost and the larger quantity of safety stock involves higher  carrying  costs."
2826,Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) EOQ refers to the level of inventory at which the total cost of inventory comprising ordering cost and carrying cost.
2827,Determining an optimum level involves two types of cost such as ordering cost and carrying cost.
2828,The EOQ is that inventory level that minimizes the total of ordering of carrying cost.
2829,"EOQ can be calculated with the help of the mathematical formula:  EOQ =  2ab/c  Where,  a = Annual usage of inventories (units) b = Buying cost per order c = Carrying cost per unit  Minimum Total Cost  Carrying Cost  Cost  Ordering Cost  Q  Order Size  Fig."
2830,11.3 Economic Order Quantity  Exercise  1 (a) Find  out  the  economic  order  quantity  and  the  number  of  orders  per  year  from  the  following  information: Annual  consumption: Purchase  price  per  units:  Rs.
2831,"54  36,000  units  170  Financial Management  Ordering  cost  per  order:  Rs."
2832,150 Inventory  carrying  cost  is  20%  of  the  average  inventory.

2835,Working Capital Management  171  TECHNIQUES BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF INVENTORIES A-B-C analysis It  is  the  inventory  management  techniques  that  divide  inventory  into  three  categories based on the value and volume of the inventories; 10% of the inventory   s item contributs to 70% of value of consumption and this category is known as A category.
2836,About 20% of the  inventory  item  contributes  about  20%  of  value  of  consumption  and  this  category  is called category B and 70% of inventory item contributes only 10% of value of consumption and this category is called C category.
2837,Inventory Breakdown Between Value and Volume  Category  Volume (%)  Value (%)  A B C  Total  10 20 70 100  70 20 10 100  ABC analysis can be explained with the help of the following Graphical presentation.
2838,Value of   Inventory (%)  A  B  C  Volume of Inventory (%)  Fig.
2839,11.4 ABC Analysis  Aging Schedule of Inventories Inventories  are  classified  according  to  the  period  of  their  holding  and  also  this  method helps to identify the movement of the inventories.
2840,"Hence, it is also called as, FNSD analysis    where,  F  = Fast moving inventories N = Normal moving inventories S  = Slow moving inventories D = Dead moving inventories  172  Financial Management  This analysis is mainly calculated for the purpose of taking disposal decision of the  inventories."
2841,VED Analysis This  technique  is  ideally  suited  for  spare  parts  in  the  inventory  management  like  ABC analysis.
2842,Inventories  are  classified  into  three  categories  on  the  basis  of  usage  of  the inventories.
2843,"V = Vital item of inventories E = Essential item of inventories D = Desirable item of inventories  HML Analysis Under this analysis, inventories are classified into three categories on the basis of the value of the inventories."
2844,H = High value of inventories M = Medium value of inventories L = Low value of inventories  TECHNIQUES ON THE BASIS OF RECORDS A.
2845,Inventory budget It is a kind of functional budget which facilitates the estimated inventory required for the business  concern  during  a  particular  period.
2846,This  budget  is  prepared  based  on  the  past experience.
2847,B.
2848,"Inventory reports Preparation of periodical inventory reports provides information regarding the order level, quantity to be procured and all other information related to inventories."
2849,"On the basis of these  reports,  Management  takes  necessary  decision  regarding  inventory  control  and Management in the business concern."
2850,Valuation of Inventories Inventories  are  valued  at  different  methods  depending  upon  the  situation  and  nature  of manufacturing process.
2851,Some of the major methods of inventory valuation are mentioned as follows:  1.
2852,First  in  First  Out  Method  (FIFO) 2.
2853,Last  in  First  Out  Method  (LIFO) 3.

2875,CASH  MANAGEMENT Business concern needs cash to make payments for acquisition of resources and services for  the  normal  conduct  of  business.
2876,Cash  is  one  of  the  important  and  key  parts  of  the current assets.
2877,Cash  is  the  money  which  a  business  concern  can  disburse  immediately  without  any restriction.
2878,"The term cash includes coins, currency, cheques held by the business concern and balance in its bank accounts."
2879,"Management of cash consists of cash inflow and outflows, cash flow within the concern and cash balance held by the concern etc."
2880,Motives for Holding Cash  1.
2881,Transaction  motive  It  is  a  motive  for  holding  cash  or  near  cash  to  meet  routine  cash  requirements to finance transaction in the normal course of business.
2882,"Cash is needed to make purchases  of  raw  materials,  pay  expenses,  taxes,  dividends  etc."
2883,2.
2884,Precautionary  motive  It is the motive for holding cash or near cash as a cushion to meet unexpected contingencies.

2949,Speculative  motive  Financial Management  It  is  the  motive  for  holding  cash  to  quickly  take  advantage  of  opportunities typically outside the normal course of business.
2950,Certain amount of cash is needed to  meet  an  opportunity  to  purchase  raw  materials  at  a  reduced  price  or  make purchase  at  favorable  prices.
2951,4.
2952,Compensating  motive  It is a motive for holding cash to compensate banks for providing certain services or  loans.
2953,"Banks  provide  variety  of  services  to  the  business  concern,  such  as clearance  of  cheque,  transfer  of  funds  etc."
2954,Cash Management Techniques Managing cash flow constitutes two important parts:  A.
2955,Speedy  Cash  Collections.
2956,B.
2957,Slowing  Disbursements.
2958,Speedy Cash Collections Business concern must concentrate in the field of Speedy Cash Collections from customers.
2959,"For that, the concern prepares systematic plan and refined techniques."
2960,"These techniques aim  at,  the  customer    who  should  be  encouraged  to  pay  as  quickly  as  possible  and  the payment  from  customer  without  delay."
2961,"Speedy  Cash  Collection  business  concern  applies some of the important techniques as follows:  Prompt Payment by Customers  Business  concern  should  encourage  the  customer  to  pay  promptly  with  the  help  of offering discounts, special offer etc."
2962,It helps to reduce the delaying payment of customers and the firm can avoid delays from the customers.
2963,"The firms may use some of the techniques for prompt payments like billing devices, self address cover with stamp etc."
2964,Early Conversion of Payments into Cash  Business  concern  should  take  careful  action  regarding  the  quick  conversion  of  the payment into cash.
2965,"For this purpose, the firms may use some of the techniques like postal float, processing float, bank float and deposit float."
2966,"Concentration Banking  It is a collection procedure in which payments are made to regionally dispersed collection centers,  and  deposited  in  local  banks  for  quick  clearing."
2967,It  is  a  system  of  decentralized billing and multiple collection points.
2968,Lock Box System  It is a collection procedure in which payers send their payment or cheques to a nearby post box that is cleared by the firm   s bank.
2969,Several times that the bank deposit the cheque  Working Capital Management  177  in the firms account.
2970,"Under the lock box system, business concerns hire a post office lock box at important collection centers where the customers remit payments."
2971,The local banks are authorized to open the box and pick up the remittances received from the customers.
2972,"As a result, there is some extra savings in mailing time compared to concentration bank."
2973,Slowing Disbursement An effective cash management is not only in the part of speedy collection of its cash and receivables  but  also  it  should  concentrate  to  slowing  their  disbursement  of  cash  to  the customers or suppliers.
2974,Slowing disbursement of cash is not the meaning of delaying the payment or avoiding the payment.
2975,Slowing disbursement of cash is possible with the help of the following methods:  1.
2976,Avoiding  the  early  payment  of  cash  The firm should pay its payable only on the last day of the payment.
2977,"If the firm avoids  early  payment  of  cash,  the  firm  can  retain  the  cash  with  it  and  that  can be  used  for  other  purpose."
2978,2.
2979,Centralised  disbursement  system  Decentralized  collection  system  will  provide  the  speedy  cash  collections.
2980,Hence centralized disbursement of cash system takes time for collection from our accounts as  well  as  we  can  pay  on  the  date.
2981,Cash Management Models Cash  management  models  analyse  methods  which  provide  certain  framework  as  to  how the  cash  management  is  conducted  in  the  firm.
2982,Cash  management  models  are  the development of the theoretical concepts into analytical approaches with the mathematical applications.
2983,There are three cash management models which are very popular in the field of  finance.
2984,1.
2985,Baumol model The basic objective of the Baumol model is to determine the minimum cost amount of cash conversion and the lost opportunity cost.
2986,It is a model that provides for cost efficient transactional balances and assumes that the demand for cash can be predicated with certainty and determines the optimal conversion size.
2987,"Total conversion cost per period can be calculated with the help of the following formula:  t=   Tb C  where,  T = Total transaction cash needs for the period b  =  Cost per conversion C = Value of marketable securities  178  Financial Management  Opportunity cost can be calculated with the help of the following formula;  i =  C 2  where,  i = interest rate earned  C/2 = Average  cash  balance Optimal cash conversion can be calculated with the help of the following formula;  C =  2bT  i  where,  C = Optimal conversion amount b =  Cost of conversion into cash per lot or transaction T =  Projected cash requirement i = interest rate earned  2."
2988,Miller-Orr model This  model  was  suggested  by  Miller  Orr.
2989,This  model  is  to  determine  the  optimum  cash balance level which minimises the cost of management of cash.
2990,"Miller-Orr Model can be calculated with the help of the following formula;  C =   bE (N)  t   +  iE (M)  where,  C = Total cost of cash management b = fixed cost per conversion  E(M) = expected average daily cash balance E (N) = expected  number  of  conversion  t = Number of days in the period i =  lost opportunity cost  3."
2991,Orgler   s model Orgler  model  provides  for  integration  of  cash  management  with  production  and  other aspects  of  the  business  concern.
2992,Multiple  linear  programming  is  used  to  determine  the optimal cash management.
2993,"Orgler   s model is formulated, based on the set of objectives of the firm and specifing the  set of constrains of the firm."
2994,Working Capital Management  179  RECEIVABLE  MANAGEMENT The term receivable is defined as debt owed to the concern by customers arising from sale of  goods  or  services  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.
2995,Receivables  are  also  one  of  the major parts of the current assets of the business concerns.
2996,"It arises only due to credit sales to customers, hence, it is also known as Account Receivables or Bills Receivables."
2997,Management of account receivable is defined as the process of making decision resulting to the investment of funds in these assets which will result in maximizing the overall return on the investment of the firm.
2998,The objective of receivable management is to promote sales and profit until that point is reached where the return on investment in further funding receivables is less than the cost of funds raised to finance that additional credit.
2999,The costs associated with the extension of credit and accounts receivables are identified  as follows:  A.
3000,Collection  Cost B.
3001,Capital  Cost C. Administrative  Cost D. Default  Cost.
3002,Collection Cost This cost incurred in collecting the receivables from the customers to whom credit sales have been made.
3003,Capital Cost This is the cost on the use of additional capital to support credit sales which alternatively could  have  been  employed  elsewhere.
3004,"Administrative Cost This is an additional administrative cost for maintaining account receivable in the form of salaries to the staff kept for maintaining accounting records relating to customers, cost of investigation etc."
3005,Default Cost Default  costs  are  the  over  dues  that  cannot  be  recovered.
3006,Business  concern  may  not  be able to recover the over dues because of the inability of the customers.
3007,Factors Considering the Receivable Size Receivables size of the business concern depends upon various factors.
3008,Some of the important factors are as follows:  180  Financial Management  1.
3009,Sales  Level Sales level is one of the important factors which determines the size of receivable of the firm.
3010,"If the firm wants to increase the sales level, they have to liberalise their credit policy and terms and conditions."
3011,"When the firms maintain more sales, there will be a possibility of large size of receivable."
3012,2. Credit Policy Credit policy is the determination of credit standards and analysis.
3013,It may vary from firm to firm or even some times product to product in the same industry.
3014,Liberal credit policy leads to increase the sales volume and also increases the size of receivable.
3015,Stringent credit policy reduces the size of the receivable.
3016,"3.  Credit Terms Credit terms specify the repayment terms required of credit receivables, depend upon the credit terms, size of the receivables may increase or decrease."
3017,"Hence, credit term is one of the factors which affects the size of receivable."
3018,4.  Credit  Period It  is  the  time  for  which  trade  credit  is  extended  to  customer  in  the  case  of  credit  sales.
3019,Normally it is expressed in terms of    Net days   .
3020,5.
3021,Cash Discount Cash discount is the incentive to the customers to make early payment of the due date.
3022,A special discount will be provided to the customer for his payment before the due date.
3023,6.
3024,Management of Receivable It is also one of the factors which affects the size of receivable in the firm.
3025,"When the management involves systematic approaches to the receivable, the firm can reduce the size of receivable."
3026,"Exercise  4 The  board  of  directors  of  Aravind  mills  limited  request  you  to  prepare  a  statement showing the working capital requirements for a level of activity of 30,000 units of output for the year."

3450,18 Crore  FACTORING Factoring is a service of financial nature involving the conversion of credit bills into cash.
3451,"Accounts receivables, bills recoverables and other credit dues resulting from credit sales appear, in the books of accounts as book credits."
3452,"Here the risk of credit, risk of credit worthiness of the debtor and as number of incidental and consequential risks are involved."
3453,These risks are taken by  the  factor  which  purchase  these  credit  receivables  without  recourse  and  collects  them when due.
3454,These balance-sheet items are replaced by cash received from the factoring agent.
3455,Factoring is also called    Invoice Agent    or purchase and discount of all    receivables   .
3456,"Although these can be with recourse or without recourse, normally the risk is taken by the factoring agent."
3457,"The discount rate includes the loss of interest, risk of credit and risk of loss of both principal and interest on the amount involved."
3458,Myths on Factoring  Myth  Fact  Factoring is nothing but bill discounting or bill finance Factoring and bill discounting are two different products  tailored  for  two  different  markets.
3459,Factoring is meant for    Open account sales    and  caters  largely  to  a  buyer   s  market.
3460,Bill discounting is normally prevalent in a seller   s market.
3461,Factoring unlike bill discounting offers a  continuous  relationship.
3462,"Factoring  reduces  bankers  business  Factoring is not merely financing and includes a package of services like collection and follow- up of each invoice, credit insurance."
3463,"MIS support etc., and improves the health of bank   s clients, improveds  cash  flow  through  factoring, increases production cycles and need for more working  capital."
3464,Factoring  essentially  aims  at replacing  high  cost  market  credit  and  not necessarily  reduce  bank  finance.
3465,Contd....  Special Financing  Factoring is an high cost borrowing  Factoring service charge is high  Factoring is meant for manufacturing units only  Factoring limits falls within MBBF/ Assessed Bank  finance  207  Comparable to interest rates of banks.
3466,"(SSI     13.50%  to  15.75%  Non-SSI  13.50%  to 17.25%) Will to offer SBI   s PLR selectively)  Service Charge is 0.1% to 0.3%  only whereas in  Bills  discounting,  the  collection  charge  is 0.5% to 0.6%."
3467,"Extended to all sectors namely Manufacturing, Trading and Services."
3468,Factoring is to be classified as other Current liability  as  per  RBI  guidelines  and  Factoring replaces market credit and not bank borrowings.
3469,History of the Early Factoring in Roman Factoring  has  not  been  documented  as  having  been  used  by  the  Romans.
3470,"However,  the word    factoring    has a Roman root."
3471,It is derived from the Latin verb    facio    which can be translated  as     he  who  does  things   .
3472,"In  Roman  times  this  referred  to  agent  of  a  property owner, i.e., his business manager."
3473,"Though the root word has nothing to do with the industry, as they attempt to help their clients through their financial problem."
3474,"Factoring in United States Factoring arose in the United States during 19th century, as direct result of the inability of manufacturers to maintain constant and timely communications with their sales forces in the field."
3475,"At that time, as the case today, the sales force was paid by communications."
3476,"If all sales were at the risk of the manufacturer, the salesman had no incentive to exercise prudence in connection with whom to sell to on credit."
3477,"On the other hand, the distant manufacturer was not in the position to make the credit risk  on  sales."
3478,The  risk  of  defective  or  non-conforming  merchandise  remained  with  the manufacturer.
3479,"The credit risk was now separated from disputes as to quality, workmanship and conformity of goods."
3480,"Soon after, the salesman began to act as independent sales agencies."
3481,It was common for them to act for more than one manufacturer.
3482,"Still later the sales function was separated from the credit function and    Traditional Factoring    as the people know, it had, at that point, developed in the United States."
3483,Factoring in India Banks provide generally bill collection and bill discounting and with recourse.
3484,They provide working capital finance based on these bills classified by amounts maturity wise.
3485,Such bills if  accumulated  in  large  quantities  will  burden  the  liquidity  and  solvency  position  of  the company and reduces the credit limits from the banks.
3486,It is therefore felt necessary that the company assigns these book debts to a factor for taking them off from the balance sheet.
3487,"This reduces the workload, increases the solvency and improves the liquidity position of the  company."
3488,208  Financial Management  In 1998 a study group under the chairmanship of C.S.
3489,"Kalyana Sundram was constituted to examine the feasibility of factoring services in India, their constitution, organizational set up and scope of activities."
3490,"The group recommended the setting up of specialized agencies or subsidiaries for providing the factoring services in India with a professional expertise in credit assessment, debt collection and management of sales ledger, and other related services."
3491,Defaults  or  delays  in  collection  and  repayment  can  still  remain  which  is  the  risk  to  be taken by the factor for a fee.
3492,The group has estimated a good potential for this service to the  tune  of  about  Rs.
3493,"4000  crores  mainly  emerging  a  collection  problem,  and  delays  in collection  and  consequential  liquidity  problems."
3494,Later the Vaghul Committee report on money market reforms has confirmed the need for factoring services to be developed in India as part of the money market instruments.

3496,The Reserve Bank allowed some banks to set up subsidiaries on a zonal basis to take care of the requirements of companies in need of such service.
3497,"Thus Canara Bank, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and a few other banks have been permitted to set up jointly some factor, for Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern Zones."
3498,"The progress of the activity did not show any worth while dimension, so far."
3499,"Modus of Operations If  a  company  wants  to  factor  its  receivables  it  submits  a  list  of  customers,  their  credit rating,  amount  involved  in  maturity  and  other  terms."
3500,"If  the  factor  scrutinizes  the  list  of buyers and they are in the approved list, the factor gives its decision of the clients and the amounts  they  may  take  all  receivables  on  wholesale  discounting  basis."
3501,"The  factor  then takes  all  the  documents  in  respect  of  approved  list  and  pays  up  to  80%  to  90%  of  the amount  due  less  commission  to  the  company  which  in  turn  removes  these  instruments, from base of accounts and shows cash flow as against bills receivables written off."

3567,12.2  Mechanics of Factoring  210  Financial Management    The following are the steps for factoring:  1.
3568,The  customer  places  an  order  with  the  seller  (client).
3569,2.

3571,3.
3572,Sale  contract  is  entered  into  with  the  buyer  and  the  goods  are  delivered.
3573,The  invoice  with  the  notice  to  pay  the  factor  is  sent  alongwith.

3584,9.
3585,The  balance  20%  less  the  cost  of  factoring  is  paid  by  the  factor  to  the  client.
3586,"Types of factoring  (1) Notified factoring:  Here, the customer is intimated about the assignment of  debt to  a  factor,  also  directed  to  make  payments  to  the  factor  instead  of  to  the  firm."
3587,This is invariably done by a legend and the invoice has been assigned to or sold to  the  factor.
3588,"(2) Non-notified or confidential factoring:  Under this facility, the supplier/factor arrangement  is  not  declared  to  the  customer  unless  or  until  there  is  a  breach  of the agreement on the part of the client, or exceptionally, where the factor considers himself  to  be  at  risk."
3589,"(3) With  recourse  or  without  recourse  factoring: Under recourse arrangements, the client will carry the credit risk in respect of debts sold to the factor."
3590,"In without recourse  factoring,  the  bad  debts  are  borne  by  the  factor."

4136,LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was set up in the year 1956 by nationalizing 245 insurance companies.
4137,The Primary objective of nationalization was to protect the interest of policy-holders against misuses and embezzlement of funds by private insurance companies.
4138,"Secondly,  the  object  of  nationalization  was  to  direct  investment  of  funds  in  government securities, leaving a meager  part for the private sector."
4139,What  marks  and  distinguishes  the  LIC  from  other  long-term  financial  institutions  is this that it discharges the two fold  function of mobilization of long-term savings and their effective  channelisation  as  well.
4140,The  other  agencies  are  suppliers  of  fund  obtained  from government and the Reserve Bank of India.
4141,Role of LIC The activities of the LIC can be broadly classified into two categories.
4142,"First, it mobilizes long- term contractual savings."
4143,"Its policy-holders view the LIC as a trustee of their funds, a source of  emergency  fund  to  guard  against  any  financial  misfortune  and  a  way  to  accumulates funds by the time of retirement from work."
4144,As an agency it is designed to the inculcation of savings for the sake of rainy days.
4145,"242  Financial Management  During the last forty years of its operations, there has been concentration of colossal  funds in hands of this monolithic state owned corporation."
4146,The  resources  thus  obtained  by  the  LIC  from  policy-holders  are  invested  in  diverse ways for different purposes.
4147,Basically LIC is an investment institution.
4148,It is a big investor of funds in government marketable securities.
4149,"Since April, 1975 the amended Section 27A of the Insurance Act, 1938 the LIC is required to invest to not less than 50% of its accruals of  premium  income  in  government  marketable  securities."
4150,Of  this  not  less  than  25%  in central  government  securities.
4151,"Besides  it  has  to  give  loans  to  approved  authorities  like electricity boards or state government for socially oriented schemes like electricity, housing, water supply etc."
4152,These loans and investments should not exceed 87.5 percent of accretion to the controlled fund of the LIC.
4153,The remaining 12.5 percent can be made to the private sector directly in the form of purchase of shares and debentures.
4154,Besides it grants loans to the private corporate sector and  finances  projects  by  subscribing  shares  and  debentures  of  private  industries.
4155,Its contribution to financing of industries in the private corporate sector is also indirect.
4156,"The investment in the share capital and bonds of IFCI, SFCs, UTI and IDBI flow back to private sector in the form of direct loans."
4157,The LIC is also engaged in underwriting new issues.
4158,The LIC plays an important role in the securities market in India.
4159,It purchases even when the market is dull (bearish) and prices are low in order to reap the benefit of future price appreciation.
4160,Nor does it usually sell shares from its stock when the market is spturn at higher prices.
4161,"Although Income Tax concessions provide incentive to higher income groups through LIC policies, the insuring public does not get the real value of its long-term savings because of chronic inflation."
4162,"Barring risk coverage, the rate of return offered by LIC is much lower compared to other savings media."
4163,It is true LIC has grown at a fast speed yet it can grow at a faster rate if it can make the message of life insurance more attractive by its operational efficiency and innovative attitude.
4164,GENERAL  INSURANCE  COMPANIES The General Insurance Corporation of India(GIC) was formed as a government company in  1972  under  the  General  Insurance  Business  (Nationalization)  Act  1972.
4165,Before nationalization a few big companies and about 100 small companies were in this business.
4166,All these units were merged together and reorganized into four subsidies of GIC.
4167,They are: (cid:127) National  Insurance  Company (cid:127) New  India  Assurance  Company (cid:127) Oriental  Fire  and  General  Insurance  Company (cid:127) United  India  Fire  and  General  Insurance  Company.
4168,"On January 1, 1973 of all the Indian insurance companies were transferred to the GIC."
4169,The feature of the GIC is this that it sell insurance service against some forms of risk like  Financial System  243  loss of physical assets of various kinds from fire or accident and against personal sickness and accident.

4214,It  refers  to  all  the  facilities  and  the  institutional  arrangements  for borrowing and lending term funds (medium-term and long-term funds).
4215,It does not deal in capital for purpose of investment.
4216,The demand for long-term money capital comes predominantly from private sector manufacturing industries and agriculture and from the government largely for the purpose of economic development.
4217,"As the central and state governments investment are not only on economic  overheads  as  transport,  irrigation  and  power  development  but  also  on  basic industries and some times, even consumer goods industries, they require substantial sums from  the  capital  market."

4233,"Both markets are equally important, but often the new issues market will be facilitated only when there are abundant facilities for transfer of existing securities."
4234,The capital market is also classified into Primary Capital Market and Secondary Capital Market.
4235,"The  primary  capital  market  refers  to  the  new  issues  market,  which  relates  to  the issue of shares, preference shares and debentures of non-government public limited companies, and also to the raising of fresh capital by Government companies, and also to the raising of fresh capital by Government companies and the issue of public sector bonds."

4244,India has the second largest share holding population with around 1.5 crore shareholders; next only to the United States of America which has about 5 crore shareholders.
4245,"India is significantly ahead of countries like Japan, United Kingdom and France in this regard, the Indian figure may look impressive, but it constitutes only 1.5 percent of the total population."
4246,"The country also has a large number of debenture holders, whose figure stands at around 50 lakhs (5 million)."
4247,"Here, it is important to note that most of the debenture holders are prospective  shareholders  as  they  are  waiting  for  the  conversion  of  their  debentures  into equity  shares."
4248,"The  enhanced  interest  in  capital  market  is  a  result  of  increasing industrialization, growing awareness among people and globalization of the capital market."
4249,Indian capital market can be divided into primary market (new issues market) and secondary market.
4250,Primary Market The  primary  market  refers  to  the  set  up  by  which  the  industry  raises  funds  by  issuing different  types  of  securities.
4251,"These  securities  are  issued  directly  to  the  investors,  both individual  and  institutions."
4252,"The  primary  market  discharges  the  important  function  of transfer of savings, especially of the individual, Government and public sector undertakings."
4253,"In the primary market, the new issues of securities are presented in the form of Public issues, Right issues and Private Placements."
4254,"Its efficient operation is made possible by the financial  intermediaries  and  financial  institutions,  who  arrange  long-term  financial transactions  for  the  clients."
4255,"Issues  of  the  securities  in  the  primary  market  may  be  made through (i) Prospectus, (ii) Offer for sale, and (iii) Private placement."
4256,The securities offered  Financial System  249  to  the  public  through  prospectus  are  directly  subscribed  by  the  investor.
4257,The  issuing companies  widely  publicise  the  offer  through  various  media.
4258,"The  Securities  Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has classified various issues in three groups i.e., New issues, Right issues and Preferential issues."
4259,The  SEBI  has  issued  various  guidelines  regarding  proper  disclosure  for  investor   s protection.
4260,These guidelines are required to be duly observed by the companies making issue of capital.
4261,The guidelines issued by the SEBI broadly cover the requirements regarding issue of  capital  by  the  companies.
4262,The  guidelines  are  applicable  to  all  the  companies  after  the repeal of Controller of Capital Issues (CCI ) Act 1947.
4263,"The boom in the primary capital market, that started in the mid-eighties and accelerated thereafter, started slowing down by 1995."
4264,There are several reasons for this slowing down of resource mobilization in the primary market.
4265,"In particular, the low return on new issues, some resulting in stock market fiasco, seems to have shattered the confidence of the investors."
4266,Secondary Market The secondary market refers to the network system for the subsequent sale and purchase of securities.
4267,"An investor can apply and get allotted, a specified number of securities by the issuing company in the primary market."
4268,"However, once allotted, the securities can thereafter be sold and purchased in the secondary market only."
4269,"A security emerges in the primary market, but its subsequent movement takes place in the secondary market."
4270,Secondary market is represented by stock exchanges in the capital market.
4271,Stock exchanges provide an organized market place for investors to trade in securities.
4272,A stock exchange permits the prices of the securities to be determined by the market forces.
4273,"The bidding process flows from demand and supply, underlying each security."
4274,"This means that the specific price of a security is determined, more or less, in the manner of an auction."
4275,Stock exchange provides a market in which the members (share brokers) and investors participate to ensure liquidity to the latter.
4276,"At present, there are 22 stock exchanges operating in India."
4277,Approved Stock Exchanges in India as follows:  1.

4302,"Cochin  Stock  Exchange,  Cochin  (Kerala) Secondary  market  in  India  got  a  boost  when  Over  The  Counter  Exchange  of  India (OTCEI) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) were established."
4303,"It may be noted that NSE and OTCEI have been established by the all India Financial Institution, while other stock exchanges are in the form of associations."
4304,"Methods of Raising Capital  Shares: Otherwise known as    ordinary shares    these are shares in the issued capital of company which are held on terms that make the holder a    member    of the company, entitled to vote at annual meetings and elect directors, and to participate through dividends in the profits of the company."
4305,"The holders of the ordinary shares carry the residual risk of the business: they rank after debenture holders and preference shareholders for the payment of dividends and they are liable for losses, although this liability is limited to the value of the share and to the limit of guarantee given by them."
4306,Debentures:  Fixed-interest  securities  issued  by  limited  companies  in  return  for long-term loans.
4307,The term is sometimes also used to refer to any title on a secured interest    bearing loan.
4308,Debentures are dated for redemption (i.e.
4309,"repayment of their nominal value by the borrower to the holder), debentures are usually secured."
4310,Debenture interest must be paid whether the company makes a profit or not.
4311,In the event of non-payment debenture holders  can  force  liquidation  and  rank  ahead  of  all  shareholders  in  their  claims  on  the company   s assets.
4312,"The interest which debentures bear depends partly on long-term rates of interest prevailing at the time and partly on the type of debenture, but will in any case, because  of  the  lower  risk  involved  is  less  than  borne  by  preference  shares."
4313,"Debenture shares are most appropriate for financing companies whose profits are stable and which have substantial fixed assets, such property companies."
4314,Financial System  251  Convertible  debentures: These  carry  an  option  at  a  fixed  future  date  to  convert  the stock into ordinary shares at a fixed price.
4315,"This option is compensated for by a lower rate of  interest  than  an  ordinary  debenture,  but  convertible  debentures  are  attractive  since they offer the investor, without sacrificing his security, the prospect of purchasing equity shares cheaply in the future."
4316,"For this reason, convertible debentures are issued at a time when it is difficult to raise capital either by equity or fixed interest securities."
4317,There are three ways in which a company may raise capital in the primary market.
4318,"PUBLIC  ISSUE By far the most important mode of issuing securities, a public issue involves sale of securities to the public at large."
4319,"A company making a public issue informs the public about it through statutory  announcements  in  the  newspapers,  makes  application  forms  available  through stock  brokers  and  others  and  keeps  the  subscription  open  for  a  period  of  three  to  seven days."
4320,"If  the  issue  is  over-subscribed,  the  pattern  of  allotment  is  decided  in  consultation with the stock exchange where the issue is proposed to be listed."
4321,"After the allotment pattern is finalized the company mails the allotment advice/letter alongwith refund order, if any."
4322,This is supposed to be done within 10 weeks of the closure of subscription.
4323,"If the full amount is not asked for at the time of allotment, the balance is called in one or two calls later."
4324,"The letter of allotment is exchangeable for share certificates (or debenture certificates, as the case may be), after it is duly stamped by the bank where the balance payment is made."
4325,"Of course, if the allottee wants he can sell the letter of allotment itself by transmitting it alongwith a transfer deed."
4326,"If the allottee fails to pay to call money as and when called by the company, the shares are liable to be forfeited."
4327,"In such a case, the allottee is not eligible for any refund of the amounts already paid."
4328,"While a new company set up by promoters without a track record is required to issue its shares at par, other companies are allowed to make a public issue at a premium."
4329,Right Issue A  right  issue  involves  selling  securities  in  the  primary  market  by  issuing  rights  to  the existing shareholders.
4330,"When a company issues additional equity capital, it has to be offered in the first instance to the existing shareholders on a pro rata (proportional) basis."
4331,This is required under Section 81 of the Companies Act 1956.
4332,"The shareholders however, may by a special resolution forfeit this right, partially or fully, to enable a company to issue additional capital to the public."
4333,"Private Placement In a private placement, funds are raised in the primary market by issuing securities privately to some investors without resorting to underwriting (insurance against risk by a guarantor)."
4334,"The investors in this case may by financial institutions, commercial banks, other companies, shareholders of promoting companies, and friends and associates of the promoters."
4335,252  Financial Management  Group A and Group B Shares The  listed  shares  are  divided  into  two  categories:  Group  A  shares  (also  referred  to  as cleared securities or specified shares) and Group B shares (also referred to as non-cleared securities or non-specified shares).
4336,"For Group A shares, the facility for carrying forward a transaction from one account period to another is available; for Group B shares, it is not."
4337,"Group A shares basically represent large, well-established companies that have a broad investor base and are very actively traded."
4338,"Since  transactions  in  these  shares  can  be  carried  forward,  these  shares  attract  a  lot  of speculative trading."
4339,"This seems to be the reason why these shares, other things being equal, tend to command higher price-earning multiples."
4340,"This is clear from the fact that whenever a share is moved from Group B to Group A, its market price rises; likewise, when a share is shifted from group A to Group B market price declines."
4341,The  Mumbai  Stock  Exchange  employs  several  criteria  for  shifting  stocks  from  the non-specified  list  to  the  specified  list.
4342,The  key  ones  are  that  the  company  must  have  an equity base of Rs.
4343,"10 crore, a market capitalization of Rs."
4344,"25   30 crore, a public holding of 35 to 40 percent, a shareholding population of 15,000 to 20,000 a dividend paying status and a good growth potential."
4345,"SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (SEBI) In 1988, SEBI was created by an administrative feat of the Ministry of Finance."
4346,Since then SEBI  has  gradually  been  granted  more  and  more  powers.
4347,"With  the  repeal  of  the  Capital Issues Control Act and the enactment of the SEBI Act in 1992, the regulation of the primary market has become the preserve of SEBI."
4348,"Further, the Ministry of Finance has transferred a  number  of  powers  under  the  Securities  Contracts  (Regulation)  Act  1956  also  to  SEBI."
4349,"Before  the  establishment  of  the  SEBI,  the  principal  legislations  governing  the  securities markets in India were the Capital Issues Control Act 1956 (governing the primary market) and the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act 1956 (governing the secondary market)."
4350,"The regulatory powers were vested with the Controller of Capital Issues (for the primary market) and the Stock Exchange Division (for the secondary market) in the Ministry of Finance, Government of India."
4351,Functions  1.
4352,The  SEBI  Act  armed  SEBI  with  statutory  powers.

4354,It  has  entrusted  SEBI  with  the  responsibility  of  dealing  with  various  matters relating  to  the  capital  market.
4355,SEBI   s  principle  tasks  are  to:  1.
4356,2.  regulate  the  business  in  stock  exchanges  and  any  other  securities  market.

4366,Trading Procedure at Stock Exchanges Securities can be traded at a stock exchange only if it is listed at that stock exchange or any of the other stock exchanges.
4367,"Listing is a procedure by which, the issuing company has to enter into an agreement, called the listing agreement, with a stock exchange and has to abide by the clauses of the listing agreement regarding disclosure of information, payment of listing fees redressal of investor   s grievance etc."
4368,"Once listed, the security can be traded at other stock exchanges too."
4369,The sale and purchase (transaction) of securities at the stock exchange can be done only through registered share brokers.
4370,An investor desiring to enter into a transaction has to place an order with one of the share brokers.
4371,"In the    outcry    system where the brokers used to shout, the deals are confirmed in few hours but in the screen-based system, the deals are confirmed immediately."
4372,"The investor then gives the delivery of the securities in case of sale, or makes the payment in case of purchase of security, to the stock broker."
4373,The stock broker in turn makes the payment for the securities sold or delivers the security certificate  purchased  on  the  completion  of  settlement  programme  of  the  stock  exchange.

4490,Banks have been asked to ensure that the interest rates charged remain within reasonable limits.
4491,"Subsequently, the ceiling on interest rates on inter-bank call and short notice money, inter short-term deposits, bills rediscounting and inter-bank participation were removed from May 1989 and the rates were permitted to be determined by market forces."
4492,Indian Money Market  Organised Banking  Sector  Unorganised Banking  Sector  Sub-markets  Call Money  Market  Bill Market  364 Days Bill  Market  Certificates of Deposits (CDs)  Commercial Papers (CPs)  Commercial  Bill  Treasury  Bills (91 days)  Fig.
4493,13.9  Indian Money Market  Financial System  259  1.
4494,Call  money  market:  It  is  the  market  for  very  short-term  funds  repayable  on demand  and  with  the  maturity  period  is  less  than  15  days.
4495,"Call  money  market is  mainly  located  in  major  industrial  and  commercial  areas  like  Delhi,  Mumbai, Kolkatta,  Chennai  and  Ahmedabad."
4496,2.
4497,"Treasury  bill  market:  Treasury  bills  are  also  one  of  the  short-term  financial instruments, which deal in money market."
4498,Treasury bill is a kind of finance bill or promissory note issued by the government to raise short-term funds.
4499,Treasury bills  duration  vary  from  14  days  to  364  days.
4500,"Traditionally,  the  Indian  money  market  had  suffered  from  inadequacy  of  short- term credit instruments."
4501,"On the recommendations of the Vaghul Working Group, the  RBI  has  introduced  many  new  money  market  instruments."
4502,Treasury  bills:  Instruments  for  short-term  borrowing  by  the  government.
4503,The bills are promissory notes to pay to the bearer after the maturity period.
4504,The bills are  issued  by  tender  to  the  Money  Market  and  to  Government  Departments.
4505,"Tenders are invited every week from bankers, discount houses and brokers."
4506,The Treasury Bills provide the government with a highly flexible and relatively cheap means  of  borrowing  money  to  meet  its  fluctuating  needs  for  cash.
4507,"In the past there were only 91days treasury bills, which were traded in the Indian money market."
4508,"The new instruments introduced by the RBI are: 182 days treasury bills,  364  days  treasury  bills,  longer  maturity  treasury  bills,  dated  Governments securities,  certificates  of  deposits  and  commercial  paper."
4509,"At  one  time,  the  demand  for  the  treasury  bills  by  commercial  banks  was  solely governed by Statutory Liquidity Ration (SLR) considerations."
4510,This is not true any more.
4511,"Besides,  the  secondary  market  transactions  in  them  are  being  increasingly driven  by  the  felt-need  for  effective  management  of  short-term  liquidity  by  the commercial  banks."
4512,182  days  treasury  bills  were  variable  interest  bills  and  were  sold  through fortnightly  auctions.
4513,The  yield  of  these  long-dated  papers  had  become  attractive for  a  highly  liquid  instrument.
4514,These  were  replaced  by  364  days  treasury  bills.
4515,"364  days  treasury  bills  there  is  a  considerable  scope  for  banks  and  financial institutions to be interested in long-dated bills, as they are far superior to their loan assets and investments which cannot be easily liquidated in times of need, without incurring heavy loses."
4516,The 364 days Treasury Bills have thus become an important instrument  of  Government  borrowing  from  the  market  and  also  leading  money market instrument in the sense that their yield is most reflective of market conditions.
4517,Financial  institutions  recongnise  the  yield  rate  on  364  days  Treasury  Bills   at present around 12.5 to 13 percent   as anchor rate on the basis of which interest rate  instruments  are  floated.
4518,"The fortnightly offerings of these bills bring in, annually, about Rs."
4519,"20,000 crores to the Government."
4520,These bills are entirely held by the market and RBI does not subscribe to them.
4521,"RBI introduced two more Treasury Bills in 1997: (i) 14 days  260  Financial Management  Intermediate  Treasury  Bills  from  April  1997  at  a  discount  rate  equivalent  to the rate of interest on ways and means advances to the Government of India   these bills  cater  to  the  needs  of  State  Governments,  foreign  central  banks  and  other specified  bodies  (these  have  surplus  funds  which  can  be  invested  for  very  short periods), (ii) A new category of 14 days Treasury Bills,  sold through action for  the  first  time  in  June  1997  to  meet  the  cash  management  requirements  of various  sections  of  the  economy."
4522,Dated  Government  Securities:    The  Government  of  India  has  also  decided  to sell dated securities (of 5 year maturity and 10 maturity) on an auction basis.
4523,The purpose  of  this  Government  decision  is: (i) (ii) (iii)  to  develop  dated  securities  as  a  monetary  instrument  with  flexible  yields; to  provide  financial  instruments  to  suit  investors     expectations;  and to  meet  Government  needs  directly  from  the  market.
4524,"A very interesting development is the introduction of repurchase auctions (Repos, for short), since December 1992, in respect of Central Government dated securities."
4525,Repos are now a regular feature of RBI   s market operations.
4526,One purpose of Repos is to even out short- term fluctuations in liquidity of the money market.
4527,"When Government securities are repurchased from the market, RBI makes payment to commercial  banks  and  this  adds  to  their  liquidity."
4528,Repos  are  developing  into  a  useful instrument to even out sharp fluctuations in the money market.
4529,Discount and Finance House of India Ltd. (DFHI) DFHI has been set up as a port of the package of reform of the money market.
4530,"It fills the long-standing need of a discount house in India, which will buy bills and other short-term paper from banks and financial institutions."
4531,"In this way, DFHI enables banks and financial institutions to invest their idle funds for short periods in bills and short dated paper."
4532,"Banks can sell their short-term securities to DFHI and get funds, in case they need them, without  disturbing  their  investments."
4533,The  DFHI  has  been  very  active  in  the  short-term money market and has effectively contributed to the overall stability of the money market.
4534,3.
4535,Commercial bills market: Another Sub-division of money market is commercial bill  market.
4536,"A  commercial  bill  or  a  bill  of  exchange  is  a  short-term,  negotiable, and self liquidating money market instrument."
4537,"It may be classified into clean bills, document bills, inland bills, foreign bills, accommodation bills and supply bills etc."

4547,4.
4548,Certificate  of  deposits(CDs):  The  CDs  are  another  important  instrument  of money  market.

4550,25  lakhs  subject  to a  minimum  amount  of  Rs.
4551,1  crore.

4554,CDs  are  freely  transferable  after  45 days  from  the  date  of  issue.
4555,Money Market Mutual Funds(MMMFs) In April 1992 the Government announced the setting up of Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs)  with  the  purpose  of  bringing  Money  Market  instruments  within  the  reach  of individuals.
4556,Scheduled commercial banks and public financial institutions would set up the MMMFs.
4557,The shares/units of MMMFs would be issued only to individuals.
4558,"In this respect, they will differ from UTI and other mutual funds which have been mobilizing the savings of the middle classes (and also of others including companies) for investment in equities in the capital market."
4559,"Mutual  funds  have  emerged  as  an  important  segment  of  financial  markets  in  India, especially following the initiatives taken by Government in the 1999   2000."

4562,The mutual fund industry has witnessed several innovations in the current financial year.
4563,The monetary and credit policy for 1999   2000 has permitted money market mutual funds  to  offer  cheque  writing  facility  to  unit  holders.
4564,Some  of  the  Mutual  Funds  have introduced limited cheque writing facility by allowing its unit holders to issue cheques against a savings account with a designated bank.
4565,The Mid-term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy announced the decision to permit scheduled commercial banks to offer    cheque writing    facility to Gilt Funds and those Liquid income Schemes of Mutual Funds which predominantly (not less than 80 percent of the corpus) invest in money market instruments.
4566,"Another significant development related to the  emergence  of  sector  funds  targeting  sectors  such  as  information  technology, pharmaceuticals, fast moving consumer goods, etc."
4567,"Equally important was the emergence of Dedicated Gilt Fund envisaging 100 percent investment in Government securities, which has made the Gilt Market accessible to small investors."
4568,"In order to promote dematerialization, the mutual fund industry introduced an innovative product facilitating investment solely in dematerialized securities and exchange of any security in dematerialised segment for the units of the scheme."
4569,262  Financial Management  Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) The  Union  Budget  for  1999   2000  stressed  the  need  for  higher  investment  in  venture capital activity (investment in economic activities where risk is high and there is considerable innovation  involved  e.g.
4570,in  the  knowledge  based  enterprises).
4571,"As  it  is  difficult  to  access capital market to raise funds for technology development/demonstration, especially for small and medium industries, VCF has a major role to play in this area."
4572,The National Venture Fund for Software and IT industry (NVFSIT) launched in the current  financial  year  merits  mention  in  this  context.
4573,"The  Small  Industry  Development Bank of India (SIDBI) Venture Capital Ltd. (SVCL) manages NVFSIT, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SIDBI."
