"Modi's 'Make in India' not enough to pip China, says top energy body","NEW DELHI: India is unlikely to replace China as the driver of global industrialization in the near future and the level of industrial investment in the country is lower than what is required to meet the ambitious  Make in India  initiative, according to the International Energy Agency. This comes despite the Modi government s major focus on economic reforms and efforts at boosting manufacturing activity.  In contrast with China, India s economy is continuing to grow strongly, a trend that is expected to persist through to 2020: Gross Domestic Product is projected to grow by between 7.5 per cent and 7.7 per cent per year up to 2020, according to IEA. The Modi government s Make in India campaign, launched in 2014, aims to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP from 17 per cent in 2013 to 25 per cent by 2020.   However, industrial investment currently falls short of what is required to achieve this target, suggesting that India will not replace China as the motor of global industrialisation in the near future,  the Paris-based agency said in its just-released World Energy Investment (WEI) 2016 report. India's industrial output fell 2.4 per cent in July after a spurt in May and June, mostly due to a decline in manufacturing output. The slowdown in industrial activity does not bode well for Asia's third largest economy, especially after overall GDP growth faltered to a 15-month low between April and June.  The 177-page IEA report, reviewed by ETEnergyWorld, also states that Indian coal production continues to be supported by strong investment, unlike the rest of the world where coal demand has declined largely because of China and the US.  Rapid growth in electricity demand, as well as energy security and cost considerations, are continuing to drive large investments in coal-fired capacity in India and the region of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),  the report says.  Globally, coal investment jumped from around $30 billion in 2000 to $90 billion in 2012. However, 2015 witnessed a reduction in global coal investment due to slowing coal consumption in China and the United States   the two biggest markets   coupled with ample supply capacity and a deteriorating outlook for demand due to weaker economic prospects in China and tougher environmental policies.  The main exception was India, where government programmes are expected to push coal demand higher,  the report, published earlier this month, said.  India s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had on Monday said in her speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) India will play a leading role in combating climate change. According to the report, long-term contracts are helping to mobilise investment in renewables in emerging markets like India, but difficulties in upgrading the grid in order to integrate them into the system persist.  The report notes the Indian government s  round-the-clock energy for all  and  Make in India  policies are helping to push up coal demand, with the majority of new coal supplies coming from domestic production. The government is targeting 1.5 billion tonnes of output by 2020. Investment by coal producers, especially state-owned Coal India, which accounts for 80 per cent of the country s production, is rising accordingly. Coal India increased capital expenditure in coal mining by around 20 per cent to over $800 million in 2015 and plans to spend even more in 2016, it said.  The Modi government is working on a target to increase the country's renewable energy capacity over 5 times from 32,000 Mw in 2014 to 175,000 Mw by 2022 -- the largest renewable energy expansion programme in the world. As part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) on climate change by 2030, the government has committed to reduce emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 per cent over 2005 levels and achieve 40 per cent installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy sources. Renewables currently account for 15 per cent of the country's total power capacity of 3 lakh Mw.  IEA has also pointed at less healthy financial indicators for power companies in India stating that stagnant cash flows and falling capital expenditures reflect the increased risk of not being able to recover investments.  Retail electricity tariffs are not always high enough to fully cover costs and some state Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) companies continue to face severe financial problems, undermining the reliability of the network and the ability of generators to sell their output,  the report states.  Significantly, the study notes how renewable investment in India increased by over 20 per cent to just under $10 billion in 2015 -- with hydro power accounting for one-quarter of the total   but uncertainties remain over the deliverability of some low solar PV bids, the regulatory framework and how new projects will be integrated in the electricity system given the financial health of the state distribution companies and needed grid investment.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-will-not-replace-china-as-the-motor-of-industrialization-in-near-future-international-energy-agency/articleshow/54561018.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 08:34:11 GMT","NA",""," "
"Waitlisted? Don't worry, railways plans to get you a confirmed train ride soon","BENGALURU: Railway authorities have plans to introduce shadow trains in high-demand sectors such as Bengaluru-Chennai, Bengaluru-Ernakulam, Bengaluru-Howrah and Bengaluru-Belgaum.  The idea, however, is still in discussion stage and will take wings only after the Railways is able to overcome the bottlenecks.  Shadow trains are those that follow the main trains after a gap of 15 to 30 minutes. For example, Kanyakumari Express or Shatabdi Express are always full, so railways can introduce trains that closely follow these trains. By doing this, the Railways -besides dealing with rising demand -can also earn some revenue.  ""We will identify the sectors that are regularly full. But we can implement this idea only after the availability of the path and the coaches improve,"" said a railway official. ""We will need double lines, less congestion and better infrastructure,"" he added.    The Railways does not want to lose passengers, especially those booked on the AC coaches. Though small in number, they make up a substantial portion of passenger revenues, and the Railways has been exploring ways to retain this revenue.  It is precisely for this reason that the Railways introduced the alternative train accommodation scheme under the name Vikalp. It provides for alternative accommodation for passengers on tickets booked through the IRCTC site. If a traveller has booked a ticket on the Rajdhani and is waitlisted, the Railways will try to accommodate the passenger on another train running to the same destination on the same day .  First introduced on Delhi-Lucknow and Delhi-Jammu, the facility is now available on Bengaluru-Delhi route too. Vikalp is currently run as a pilot project, and authorities said they will soon be able to extend it to other high demand sectors from Bengaluru. Vikalp, the official explained, was introduced to provide confirmed accommodation to waitlisted passengers by using up every available seat as it is illegal for them to board reserved coaches. Under the scheme, the authorities are augmenting the sector capacity either by attaching additional coaches to clear waitlisted passengers or by running extra trains.  ""The facility is available only on e-ticketing option. This is not yet open on all the sectors, which we will do as we go along. This requires a lot of tweaking of the software in the reservation system,"" the official said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/waitlisted-like-irctcs-vikalp-you-can-hope-to-board-shadow-outbound-trains/articleshow/54558661.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 08:26:45 GMT","NA",""," "
"Pakistan knocks on World Bank's door to stop India from exploiting water treaty","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan today approached the World Bank amid reports that India could revoke the 56-year- old Indus Water Treaty, with senior Pakistani officials taking up the matter with the international lender which had mediated the water-sharing deal.  A delegation of the Government of Pakistan led by the Attorney General for Pakistan, Ashtar Ausaf Ali, met with senior officials of the World Bank at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington DC, to discuss matters relating to Pakistan's recent Request for Arbitration given to India pursuant to Article IX of the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960, Geo News reported.  The report also said Pakistan approached the International Court of Justice, but did not provide any details.  On 19 August, Pakistan had formally requested India for settlement of outstanding disputes pertaining to India's construction of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants on rivers Neelum and Chenab respectively, by referring the matters to the Court of Arbitration as provided in Article IX of the Treaty.  Under the treaty, the World Bank has an important role in establishment of the Court of Arbitration by facilitating the process of appointment of three judges, called Umpires, to the Court, while each country appoints two arbitrators.  The Pakistani officials met with senior officials of the World Bank to insist on early appointment of the judges and empanelment the court, it said.  The Pakistani delegation consisted of Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf Ali; Secretary, Ministry of Water & Power, Muhammad Younus Dagha; Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters, Mirza Asif Baig and others, it said.  Pakistan's Ambassador to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani and World Bank's Executive Director for Pakistan Nasir Khosa were also present.  In the meeting with the Pakistani delegation, the World Bank committed itself to timely fulfilling its obligations under the treaty while remaining neutral, the report said.  Under the treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan President Ayub Khan in September 1960, waters of six rivers - Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - were to be shared between the two countries.  The treaty provides specific design criteria for any hydro-electric power plants to be built by India. Pakistan has held the position the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants violate the design parameters of the treaty.  Earlier, Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs and Security, Sartaj Aziz said an attempt by India to block Pakistan's water could be seen as ""an act of war.""  Yesterday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with officials to review provisions of the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.  In that meeting it was decided that India will ""exploit to the maximum"" the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum, as per the water-sharing pact.  The meeting came as India weighed its options to hit back at Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri terror attack that left 18 soldiers dead, triggering demands that the government scrap the water-sharing deal to mount pressure on the country.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pakistan-approaches-world-bank-over-indus-treaty/articleshow/54559907.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 09:11:18 GMT","NA",""," "

"BPTP in talks to sell Gurgaon land to Godrej Properties","BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Real estate developer BPTP is in the process of selling its land parcel in Gurgaon to Godrej Properties. The 20-acre land along the Dwarka Expressway is valued at around Rs 350 crore, said two persons familiar with the development. ""Both the companies are in the final stages of the deal,"" said one of the persons with direct knowledge of the transaction.  BPTP is likely to utilise a part of the money received from the land sale to repay JP Morgan Chase as settlement in a dispute over the bank exiting from its investment in the company. ""Some part of the money will be paid to Citi too,"" said another person who did not want to be named. This is also one of the few transactions where Godrej Properties is buying land parcel on outright basis for project development.  The real estate development arm of Godrej Group usually prefers to enter into joint development agreements to undertake projects than buying plots on outright basis.  An email query to BPTP remained unanswered until going to press. Godrej Properties responded to query saying, ""As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on market speculation.""  Godrej Properties is currently developing residential, commercial and township projects spread across around 128 million square feet in 12 cities in India.  Earlier this year, Godrej Properties forayed into the Noida market with a development management agreement to build a housing project on a 36-acre plot.  While this is Godrej Properties' first project in Noida, it is its sixth in the National Capital Region (NCR).  Last year, BPTP agreed to buy out CPI's shareholding for Rs 333 crore and JP Morgan's shareholding for Rs 360 crore payable over a period of time. In 2006, BPTP raised Rs 322 crore from CPI India, a Citigroup fund, now managed by Apollo Management, by selling 5.67% equity stake in the company.  In 2008-09, the realtor further raised Rs 241 crore in two rounds of funding from a subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase group of companies by selling 6.21% stake.  BPTP is also in the process of selling a 25-acre land parcel in Hyderabad for Rs 250 crore to retire old debts. The company plans to sell some of the noncore assets to raise funds for meeting business requirements, said one of the persons mentioned above.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/bptp-in-talks-to-sell-gurgaon-land-to-godrej-properties/articleshow/54399987.cms","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:24:16 GMT","NA",""," "
"Teva Pharmaceutical inks largest realty deal for HQ at Goregaon","MUMBAI: The world's largest generic pharmaceutical company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, has inked a deal for 1.25 lakh sq ft office space for lease in Oberoi Realty's commercial complex Commerz II in Goregaon suburb of Mumbai in the largest transaction for headquarters by any company, said three persons familiar with the development.  ""The transaction was concluded recently and the company will start operating from the new premise in the next twothree months. The design and fit-out work will commence soon,"" said one of the persons mentioned above.  The Israeli multinational pharmaceutical company will be shifting its India headquarters and consolidating six offices in Mumbai in this newly leased space, spread over four floors. The New York Stock Exchange-listed firm's current India headquarter operations are split into two-three office buildings in the Powai suburb of Mumbai.    The drug-maker will be paying Rs 140-145 per sq ft per month for the space. Teva has leased the front-office space for five years and rentals will be escalated after three years.  Teva will be paying close to Rs 22 crore as rentals every year for the next three years. Rent will be reset for the next two years after that.  The transaction assumes significance as the space is being picked up for the company's headquarters and that too in Goregaon, not in any of the metro's business districts.  ""We are delighted that Teva Pharmaceuticals has chosen Commerz II, our commercial building and part of Oberoi Garden City, for their India headquarters. Convenient location off the Western Express Highway and the proposed metro for easy connectivity between north-south corridor of Mumbai has aided the response to Commerz II,"" said Vikas Oberoi, CMD, Oberoi Realty, confirming the transaction.  Email queries to Teva remained unanswered until the time of going to press. Transaction advisor JLL India declined to offer a comment for the story.  The transaction shows that the commercial property market in the country's commercial capital continues to be robust. Low vacancy levels across office complexes and lack of new commercial space being ready to move are contributing to the rents firming up. Vacancy levels in other commercial complexes in the vicinity along Western Express Highway including Nirlon Knowledge Park and Nesco are currently close to zero.  Since 2015, office space absorption across major Indian property markets has been growing on the back of a combination of lower rents and a positive economic outlook, which makes it certain that the recovery, this time, is more sustainable and long-term in comparison with 2011.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/teva-pharmaceutical-inks-largest-realty-deal-for-hq-at-goregaon/articleshow/54399935.cms","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:18:27 GMT","NA",""," "
"Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital drags Neelkanth township, promoter to NCLT","Private equity fund Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital (UIVC), floated by Anand Jain's Jai Corp with Reliance Industries (RIL) as an anchor investor, has filed a petition in The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Neelkanth Township & Construction and its promoter Bhavik Bhimjyani.  The petition has accused the Mumbai-based builder of misappropriation of funds, creation of fraudulent accounts, mismanagement of the company and defaulting on loans and commitments in its Alibaug residential township project. However, Bhimjyani denies these allegations. He said that the fund didn't bring in Rs 200-crore capital that was committed, leading to the project's delay.   Right from the date of investment in Neelkanth in 2007, UIVC has had its nominees on the Neelkanth board and has been aware of the activities, decisions and transactions in Neelkanth,  Bhavik Bhimjyani said in an email response. An email sent to UIVC remained unanswered until the time of going to press.  The fund also counts Bhimjyani's relatives Tulsi Bhimjyani and Anshul Bhimjyani as respondents.But Tulsi Bhimjyani responded that he and his family are neither directors nor shareholders.  The petition has alleged that Bhimjyani held illegal meetings without notifying the fund and tried to take control of the board by in creasing the number of nomineedirectors to 10 from two.  In 2007, UIVC had invested Rs 50 lakh as equity for a 40% stake in Neelkanth Township & Construction, while the promoters invested Rs 75 lakh for the remaining 60%. The fund also invested Rs 51 crore through debentures. Neelkanth Township was looking to acquire about 150 acres of land in Alibaug, near Mumbai, to develop a project to build bungalows.  In 2007-2008, UIVC had invested in two projects -Alibaug and Pune --through debentures and equity. The petition says that the builder's loan and interest repayment defaults would cumulatively amount to Rs 200 crore since 2010-11.  UIVC has also filed an application in the Bombay HC to appoint an arbitrator for its ongoing disputes.  The petition also points out that UIVC found out in August 2015 that Neelkanth Township, at the instance of the promoters, had paid Rs 5.27 crore as advance to another promoter-group company --Lighthouse Developers. The advance was paid for purported acquisition of land without indication of any location, price or area. Further, it mentions that this sum was used by Lighthouse Developers to repay the promoters' loan and not for buying land.  However, according to Bhimjyani, there is no illegal or unfair conduct either at the board or general body meetings of Neelkanth under the current management. His emailed response says, ""There has been no misappropriation of funds or creation of any fraudulent accounts or related party transactions. Allegations of non-supply of accounts   belatedly made   are false.""  According to Bhimjyani, the nominees of UIVC had not attended any board or general body meeting of Neelkanth between 2011 and 2015.From 2007, the fund hasn't made any allegations of non-receipt of notice, either of the board or of the general body meeting of Neelkanth and were made for the first time in 2015, close to the fund's expiry date.  Both parties had also held meetings between 2011 and 2012 for settlement of the issue through mediation of a large business house. However, the settlement could not be reached as the promoters of Neelkanth reneged from the terms agreed during these meetings.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/urban-infrastructure-venture-capital-dragsneelkanthtownship-promoter-tonclt/articleshow/54560125.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 06:50:52 GMT","NA",""," "
"Hindustan Copper to invest Rs 2,000 crore in new project","KOLKATA: State-run Hindustan Copper is expected to shortly seek Cabinet approval to invest Rs 2,200 crore in a new project to extract copper using a technology that is being tried out on a commercial scale for the first time globally.  The project is part of theRs 6,000 crore capital expenditure that the country s largest integrated copper producer has planned through 2021-22. The project is slated to come up at Chhattisgarh s copperrich Rajnandgaon district, adjacent to HCL s existing mine at Malanjkhand in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.   We hope to produce 1 lakh tonnes of copper cathode from this new project every year. With copper demand in India set to grow 8-9% annually, we hope to be able to add new capacity in tune with market growth,  Chairman KD Diwan said. He was speaking after the company s board meeting. The project will boost HCL s current 31,000 tonne cathode capacity by nearly threefold.  We hope to get government approval for the project within the next six months,  he said.  The project will involve hydrometallurgy, a method for obtaining metals from their ores through leaching. The technology will facilitate extraction of copper from sulphide ores prevalent in the country.  HCL will also be able to produce silver and gold as by-products. The company has shortlisted two possible technology partners, including an Israeli company, that are expected to bid for the job.  HCL is also gearing up to invest nearly Rs 100 crore to achieve full capacity at Jhagadia Copper Ltd (JCL), a company it acquired from Asset Reconstruction Company of India (ARCIL) for Rs 210 crore in Gujarat. The newly acquired unit, now renamed Gujarat Copper Project, has been revived and has started commercial production. HCL hopes to have installed copper cathode capacity of 50,000 tonnes next year.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/hindustan-copper-to-invest-rs-2000-crore-in-new-project/articleshow/54556076.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 02:34:53 GMT","NA",""," "
"Want to know which all stocks have turned expensive? Try this formula","NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market saw a meteoric rise in the last 6-7 month, thanks to the loose money policies adopted by several central banks the world over, which eased liquidity conditions and fuelled a smart rally in individual stocks which are now looking slightly expensive.  Equity benchmark Sensex has rallied over 26 per cent from its 52-week low of 22,494 and a little over 7 per cent in last three months. It has risen about 8 per cent so far in 2016 compared with a 52 per cent rally seen in the shares of PVR, 33 per cent in Tata Motors and about 11 per cent in SBI in the same period.  Some of the stocks are looking expensive and have already seen a fair bit of correction, but there could be more room for further downside as the June quarter earnings failed to cheer investors, experts said.   The current round of consolidation in the market has been due to global factors and any cue on stabilisation will bring cheer to the market. At the same time, we also find stocks where valuations have moved above historical averages, but subdued June quarter results have not left any room for further pickup in valuations,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit BNP Paribas, told ETMarkets.com.   We believe stocks like PVR, Tata Motors, ONGC, Axis Bank, Jubilant FoodWorks and NTPC have expanded beyond the recent improvement in financials, i.e. growth in price has been more than requisite,  he said.    Which are the expensive stocks?  Stocks that have either seen a strong runup in prices or are trading ahead of their fundamentals owing to any positive news flow could be trading in the high-valuation zone.  In simple terms, irrespective of quality or credentials, any stock can be considered expensive if valuation has moved substantially above historical averages and the future outlook does not offer any material upside.   For example, we did see stocks in pockets such as PSU banks and levered infrastructure players run up sharply in the current market rally. But, these segments continue to be plagued by NPAs and stretched balance sheets respectively,  Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICI Securities, told ETMarkets.com.   Therefore, the above-mentioned stocks can see huge swings as they do not merit a place in your portfolio given their hazy fundamental outlook,  he said.  How to identify expensive stocks?  Generally, investors sell off a stock, terming it as expensive, when the price goes up substantially. However, that may not be true, experts said.  If underlying earnings rise significantly, an astronomical rise in a stock is all but natural. Investors should sell a stock only when it becomes expensive and not because of daily price movement or correction in the market.  Investors can identify an expensive stock two ways. First, they should do a comparison for last 10 years on various valuation parameters such as PE and PB ratios.   For example, if the highest and lowest PE levels of a stock in last 10 years have been 30 and 15, those should be considered the benchmarks for higher and lower valuation multiples,  Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities, told ETMarkets.com.   If the stock is currently trading at the higher end of the multiple, then the stock is expensive,  he said.  The second way is to compare the valuation parameters with that of respective industry multiples.  If the stock is quoting at a multiple above industry average, then there is an opportunity to encash the premium valuation, provided the same kind of premium valuation was not available in the past,  Modi said.  ""However, the above factors are based purely on quantitative numbers. Many a time, qualitative aspects should also be looked at before taking the call to sell a stock,  he said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/want-to-know-which-all-stocks-have-turned-expensive-try-this-formula/articleshow/54558461.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 05:59:04 GMT","NA",""," "

During the visit, Modi is expected to announce the restarting of a fertiliser factory and to lay the foundation stone of the proposed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) beside addressing a rally.  To prevent movement of terrorists in the area, security agencies have been asked to ascertain identities of people before allowing them to cross over the border, IG (Gorakhpur Zone) Mohit Agarwal said.  Orders have also been issued to other security agencies such as Indo-Nepal Border Police and Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) to be on the alert at the border.

"My first year at work - 'I respected my time, indulged in cycling & photography'","Yogesh Agarwal Cofounder at CareOnGo as told to Prachi Verma Dadhwal  The brief I was given and what I did in the first 100 days at work In my first job, which was at Deloitte, I was tasked with finding process gaps in the inventory management. Though the job in itself was daunting, I couldn't stop at a single task. While understanding the process inefficiencies, I got pulled along into the entire process right from manufacturing to warehousing to stocking-giving me the entire picture to find the exact gaps. I worked closely with various health clients in the US and Europe, and while analysing the processes, I found a lot of inefficiency which could be improved.  The worst mistake I made With the initial fire of working in such a big project, I started doing extensive research by myself. After a few days of getting exhausted by it, I realised that this should have been first discussed with the team to get a picture of the challenges they faced.  The best leadership lessons I learnt As andrew carnegie said, ""No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself, or get all the credit for doing it."" I learnt pretty early that both teamwork and leadership are instrumental for a small company's success and it is the combined efforts of individual minds that can result in creating something unprecedented. On starting my venture with co-founders, I have tried to incorporate the same values in welcoming out-of-the-box ideas from other employees at work and collectively achieving the targets.  How I had fun at work Communication is a huge stress buster for me, and during late hours spent at office I started engaging in discussions-be it complex business problems or personal hurdles-with my colleague. This was to understand different mindsets.  How I managed my work-life balance I respected my ""me"" time and indulged in activities I am zealous about--cycling and photography.  Apart from meeting goals at work, I made sure I set personal goals the same way, which is why I took up adventure sports like skiing and mountain biking. I believe in striking a balance between work and play, alongside pushing myself to take up challenging activities for that adrenaline rush.  My biggest innovation My tryst was in identifying the gaps in the operational processes to maintain stock. After brainstorming with the team, I devised an algorithm which could increase the efficiency in inventory management by 23% and reduce manpower by 15%.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/my-first-year-at-work-i-respected-my-time-indulged-in-cycling-photography/articleshow/54477054.cms","Fri, 23 Sep 2016 06:10:06 GMT","NA",""," "

"Chinese Coal Mine Explosion Kills 18","A gas explosion at a Chinese coal mine has left at least 18 people dead and two more missing after what Chinese officials are calling  illegal  mining activities.


The gas explosion occurred Tuesday morning at a small coal mine in the northwestern Chinese city of Shizuishan as 20 miners were working underground, Chinese state media reported.


Xinhua cited an initial investigation in blaming illegal mining for the explosion, though the state media outlet did not provide further details.


During a news conference Wednesday, local officials said representatives from Linli Coal Mining Co. Ltd., which owns the mine, had been taken into police custody.


Wu Yuguo, vice mayor of Shizuishan City, said heavy gas concentrations and the collapse of the mine shaft had created difficulties for rescue workers.


Despite the dangerous conditions, firefighters and coal mine rescue specialists continued their search for the two missing mine workers Wednesday.


China has made great strides in improving mine safety, but its mines are still the deadliest in the world.


Accidents at Chinese mines routinely make national news, though they continue to happen as bosses disregard safety standards in the quest for higher profits.


Official government figures put the annual number of mining related deaths in China at less than 1,000, but rights groups claim the numbers are underreported and are actually much higher.","http://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-coal-mine-explosion/3528197.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 04:47:57 -0400","Asia",""," "

"US Nuclear Weapons Systems Need an Upgrade","At Sandia National Laboratories inside Kirtland Air Force Base, nuclear weapons equipment is spun around, smashed and even blown up--all to help the U.S. military modernize its nuclear weapons stockpile.


Nuclear weapons are essential for US defense


Speaking at the base Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter told troops that the nuclear mission is the  bedrock of American security. 


The U.S. can deter a nuclear attack in three ways: by land with intercontinental ballistic missiles, by air with nuclear weapons on bombers and fighter jets, and by sea with nuclear missiles roaming the oceans on submarines. These methods are more commonly known as the  nuclear triad. 


Update is necessary


But all of the programs are entering an age where they need to be modernized. 


The last B-52H bomber aircraft rolled off the production line in 1952. New B61-12 nuclear bombs currently being developed at Sandia are updating tube technology dating back several decades, but they won t be ready until 2020.







Outdated computer systems


William Schneider, President of International Planning Services and Former Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, says the expansive land-based Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) system was produced in the 1970s and is in need of a complete makeover. 


 As a benchmark of their ancient character, they still use floppy disks and computers that would be relics in any other setting apart from this,  Schneider told VOA.


And the most survivable leg of the nuclear triad, the Ohio-class submarine, has had its life extended from 30 years to 42 years and will start to age out in the next decade.


Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan took attention away


Years of underfunding and a lack of attention have raised questions about how reliable and safe the United States  most dangerous weapon will be if more action is not taken soon.


 If we re going to maintain a safe, secure, and effective force, we re going to need to do something to replace the existing delivery systems and extend the life of the nuclear weapons that we have,  Frank Klotz, the U.S. Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security, said at a recent nuclear talk hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.


While in New Mexico, Carter echoed the need to modernize all three legs of the triad and placed the blame for years of delay on being  preoccupied  in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he called  understandable. 


US trailing Russia and China


The delay has put the U.S. nuclear modernization program 20 years behind the Chinese and Russian modernization programs, according to Schneider.


 That in itself is a source of instability and something that we need to correct,  he said.


The U.S. military's top deterrent is up for a $108 billion makeover planned over the next five years. However, budget squabbles in Congress have continued to threaten the stability of future modernization plans.","http://www.voanews.com/a/us-nuclear-weapons-systems-need-an-upgrade/3528193.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 03:34:42 -0400","USA",""," "

"Malawi Girls Learn Self Defense Tactics Against Sexual Abuse","Schoolgirls in Malawi are learning what to do if someone tries to attack them. A Kenyan NGO started the training in response to a recent study that showed one in five girls under the age of 18 in Malawi has been sexually assaulted.


At a school in the Salima district of central Malawi, girls are practicing punches and jabs. But this is not a martial arts class. These girls are learning how to defend themselves.


 The curriculum involves both verbal and physical skills. Physical skill is used when it is the best and last option, meaning that we use mainly verbal skills which is how to use their voices to [prevent] the assaults,  said Loveness Thole, the Ujamaa curriculum coordinator.


The girls learn to shout for help or pretend they see someone coming to fool their attacker. They also learn techniques to disable the attacker so they can run for safety.







Instructors from the charity Ujamaa Pamodzi Africa have been conducting these weekly, two-hour lessons at schools in seven districts around Malawi.


 By the end, we would like to reduce the incidents of rape. We would also like to promote education by reducing early marriages, school drop-outs and also early pregnancies,  said Simang aliso Domoya, Ujamma project coordinator.


The U.N. Children s Fund is financing the program. So far, 25,000 girls have taken part.


Teachers like Rebecca Msalanyama say the Ujamaa interventions have removed some of the stigma around sexual assault.


 In the past, girls were not reporting it but now they are indeed empowered to report abuses. Some are reporting the incidents to us teachers and others to their parents for action,  she said.







Some girls, such as student Shang Chituzu, said they have already had to use their skills.


 My uncle ordered me to lie on his bed. When I asked why, he started touching my body. I told him to stop and that I will report him to police or my mother if he continues. After hearing this, he ordered me out of his room,  said Chituzu.

"US Presidential Candidates Take Debate Critiques to Supporters","With election day six weeks away, U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Tuesday and gave critical reviews of each other's performance in their first head-to-head debate.


Many independent analysts said Clinton won Monday's debate and could get a boost in national polls that showed her a few points ahead of Trump.


Trump lacked details


Speaking to supporters in North Carolina, Clinton cast her opponent as lacking details during the debate.


""I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president.  And you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do,"" she said.


Trump says he won


Trump said after the debate that he won, and at a rally Tuesday night in Florida suggested he could have done even better.


""For 90 minutes, I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back.  I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her,"" he said.


The two candidates will debate twice more before the November 8 vote, the next coming on October 9.




Clinton could pick up points


Political scientist Alan Abramowitz of Emory University in Atlanta and poll analyst Nate Silver both said Clinton could add another two points to her edge after she kept Trump on the defensive through much of the first debate, attacking him for refusing to release his U.S. income tax returns, for failing to pay some contractors he hired to build his golf courses and casinos, and for his lengthy history of slurs against women.


""I wouldn't be surprised if her poll numbers move up a little,"" Abramowitz told VOA. ""I think it might go up a couple points. I think it makes it a little more difficult for Trump,"" the Republican nominee, to reach a majority in the Electoral College where U.S. presidential elections are decided based on state-by-state results rather than the national popular vote.


He called Clinton's debate performance ""calm, cool and collected,"" and said she was ""able to talk about the issues."" He described Trump as ""rather bombastic and superficial. I think he got in a lot of trouble on race and gender issues.""


Trump needs practice


Emory professor Andra Gillespie said, ""I think his campaign will try to regroup and he might practice a little bit more before the next debate as opposed to bragging about how he may not have been practicing going into the (Monday) debate.""


Silver, who runs the fivethirtyeight.com election prediction Website, wrote that the contrast between Clinton, seeking to become the country's first female president, and Trump ""might be expected to produce a swing of 2 to 4 percentage points in the horse race polls"" in her favor.


Media thinks Clinton won


Another analyst, John Sides, a George Washington University political scientist, told VOA, ""My initial sense is that most reporters and commentators think that Clinton outperformed Trump. Since there is evidence that any media consensus can shape how voters also perceive the debate, that suggests that Clinton is more likely to benefit than Trump.""","http://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidential-candidates-take-debate-critiques-to-supporters/3528172.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 02:48:09 -0400","USA",""," "

Trump lacked details


Speaking to supporters in North Carolina, Clinton cast her opponent as lacking details during the debate.


""I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president.  And you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do,"" she said.


Trump says he won


Trump said after the debate that he won, and at a rally Tuesday night in Florida suggested he could have done even better.


""For 90 minutes, I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back.  I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her,"" he said.


The two candidates will debate twice more before the November 8 vote, the next coming on October 9.




Clinton could pick up points


Political scientist Alan Abramowitz of Emory University in Atlanta and poll analyst Nate Silver both said Clinton could add another two points to her edge after she kept Trump on the defensive through much of the first debate, attacking him for refusing to release his U.S. income tax returns, for failing to pay some contractors he hired to build his golf courses and casinos, and for his lengthy history of slurs against women.


""I wouldn't be surprised if her poll numbers move up a little,"" Abramowitz told VOA. ""I think it might go up a couple points. I think it makes it a little more difficult for Trump,"" the Republican nominee, to reach a majority in the Electoral College where U.S. presidential elections are decided based on state-by-state results rather than the national popular vote.


He called Clinton's debate performance ""calm, cool and collected,"" and said she was ""able to talk about the issues."" He described Trump as ""rather bombastic and superficial. I think he got in a lot of trouble on race and gender issues.""


Trump needs practice


Emory professor Andra Gillespie said, ""I think his campaign will try to regroup and he might practice a little bit more before the next debate as opposed to bragging about how he may not have been practicing going into the (Monday) debate.""


Silver, who runs the fivethirtyeight.com election prediction Website, wrote that the contrast between Clinton, seeking to become the country's first female president, and Trump ""might be expected to produce a swing of 2 to 4 percentage points in the horse race polls"" in her favor.


Media thinks Clinton won


Another analyst, John Sides, a George Washington University political scientist, told VOA, ""My initial sense is that most reporters and commentators think that Clinton outperformed Trump. Since there is evidence that any media consensus can shape how voters also perceive the debate, that suggests that Clinton is more likely to benefit than Trump.""","http://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidential-candidates-take-debate-critiques-to-supporters/3528172.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 02:48:09 -0400","USA",""," "

"Hungary to Reject Refugee Resettlement, Adding to EU s Post-Brexit Woes","There s been nothing subtle about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s campaign before Sunday s nationwide referendum on whether Hungary should agree to accept migrants under the European Union refugee resettlement plan.



Facts have been dispensed with, allege critics, and the government s language has been so abrasive about asylum-seekers, who have been portrayed as being synonymous with terrorists and criminals, that Luxembourg s foreign minister suggested earlier this month that Hungary ought to be thrown out of the EU.


Not that criticism is deterring Orb n, a liberal-turned-nationalist conservative who relishes controversy and is surfing a powerful wave of central European populism that may end up reshaping the regional bloc, taking power away from EU institutions in Brussels and placing it back in the hands of national governments.


At a fractious migration crisis summit of European leaders in Vienna a few days ago, Orb n, who along with other central European and Balkan leaders have tightened their borders to asylum-seekers, warned any new massive surge would swamp Europe.


 When the migrants descend on us and trouble arrives, it will be too late to reach for blueprints, for fences, for physical barriers, for new police and soldiers,  he cautioned.


Orb n and his ministers deny allegations of racism and say their referendum campaigning has been strictly factual. They defend posters and leaflets depicting claimed ""no go"" zones across the continent that the government alleges have become perilous for locals because of violent immigrants.


While insisting the map is based on crime statistics, Orb n spokesman Zolt n Kov cs acknowledged recently,  The picture is a bit disproportionate.  That was rare backtracking in a referendum campaign that s likely to increase divisions among European governments about how to cope with the migration crisis that has been roiling the continent for two years.


Orb n has predicted the referendum will have a domino effect with other European governments and follow Budapest s example, especially Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Like Hungary, they are in the four-nation Visegrad Group of central European countries which have been the strongest critics of EU migrant policies and are overwhelmingly white and Christian.


An earlier incarnation of an EU refugee-burden sharing plan floundered amid objections with just a few hundred asylum-seekers being resettled; but, Eurocrats in Brussels insist a renewed version will start as soon as December. 


There s little chance that Orb n will be on the losing side in the national ballot he conceived and championed on the EU mandatory relocation plan, which would involve resettling only 1,294 asylum-seekers to Hungary.


According to opinion polls, at least two-thirds of the electorate will vote  no  to resettling any migrants sent their way by the European Union. Turnout is likely to be high as a result of Saturday s nail bomb explosion in the heart of Budapest, which seriously injured two police officers. It remains unclear, though, whether the bombing was the handiwork of a jihadist or far-right group.


A recent survey found that Hungarian sentiment has hardened dramatically in the past 12 months. Initially, when thousands of war refugees from the Middle East and economic migrants from Africa arrived in Hungary, marching up from the Balkans heading to Germany and other north European countries, Hungarians were welcoming, donating clothes and essentials to the new arrivals at Budapest s main railway station and in makeshift camps that popped up in the capital.


A year ago, 64 percent of Hungarians, according to a survey, acknowledged a moral obligation to assist asylum-seekers. A survey taken last week showed a dramatic reversal with 63 percent saying there was no obligation.


Orb n critics blame the government for the shift in sentiment, arguing he has been inciting xenophobia and that it is hardly surprising Hungarians have turned against migrants and view them as a threat.


John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's director for Europe, said,  against the backdrop of a toxic referendum campaign, poisonous anti-refugee rhetoric is reaching fever pitch.  On Tuesday, Amnesty issued a toughly worded report accusing Hungary of a  flagrant breach  of international law in how it is treating refugees.


Last month, Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, compared Orb n to right-wing populists, accusing them of peddling falsehoods. He said they  seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion, living peacefully in isolation, pilots of their fate, free of crime, foreign influence and war. A past that most certainly, in reality, did not exist anywhere, ever. 


The attacks on Orb n, though, appear to be having as little impact on Hungarians as the warnings foreign leaders issued, including U.S. President Barack Obama, to Britons ahead of their Brexit referendum in June. Some observers say they are in effect playing into Orb n s hands by building up popular resentment about foreign interference in domestic politics.


A large part of the appeal of Orb n s campaign rests with his argument that nations should determine their policies and not supra-national organizations. The Hungarian leader doesn t disguise his eagerness to roll back not only EU immigration policies, but a European Union status quo that he says is out of touch with popular opinion.","http://www.voanews.com/a/hungary-to-vote-against-refugee-resettlement-adding-to-eu-post-brexit-woes/3528076.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 00:00:24 -0400","Europe",""," "

"Putin's Chechnya Strongman Tightens Grip as Future Stability in Question","At a polling station in Chechnya s capital, Grozny, children in traditional costume danced to music as voters walked past to cast their ballots.


More a celebration than an exercise in democracy as Chechen voters for the first time elected strongman Ramzan Kadyrov.


Kadyrov was directly elected for the first time September 18 by a whopping 98 percent of voters, with 95 percent of the republic voting, according to official figures, tightening his grip on power in the north Caucasus region.  


The landslide win was predictable as Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya for a decade, appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, with almost total control over the republic.  


Grozny s mayor, Muslim Khuchiev, accompanied by an entourage in full Caucasus regalia, arrived in a horse-drawn carriage with flags bearing the image of Kadyrov and no doubt about who would win.   Everyone will vote unanimously,  he told VOA,  because they are voting not just for someone s seats in the Duma (parliament), not just for someone s seats in state bodies but, they are voting for their future. 




Personality cult


Kadyrov is seen by supporters as bringing peace and development to Chechnya, after two failed wars with Russia for independence, while critics say he has become a cult of personality.


Every major street in Grozny bears an image or reference to Ramzan Kadyrov, or his father Akhmad Kadyrov, and his face is often seen on car windows, T-shirts, and souvenirs.  


The government-controlled media covers his every move, lauding him as a  Hero of Russia , an award bestowed on him by Putin.  






 All the environment around us speaks for itself,  Kadyrov supporter Melizha Karnaeva tells VOA.   I think, I even know and I am sure, that this bright blue sky, that is thanks to Ramzan Kadyrov! 


A rebel like his father, they both switched sides to join Putin, who spent billions to rebuild Chechnya and prop up Kadyrov, who in return cracked down on militants and critics.


In Grozny, Kadyrov Prospekt runs past a modern mall and hotel and business complex  Grozny City  before passing the Akhmad Kadyrov mosque to merge with Putin Prospekt.  


Stability at  huge price 


In a nondescript apartment building on Putin Prospekt, activist Abdulla Duduev tells VOA the opposition Yabloko political party fielded candidates for the election, including himself, but did no campaigning in Chechnya out of fear opposition supporters would be persecuted.  


""We keep working in the regions,  he said.   What motivates this?  This is our Republic!  We were born here.  We can t be indifferent to what is happening here,  concludes Duduev.


Tight security is visible in the center of Grozny, especially around the mosque, known as the  Heart of Chechnya,  Grozny City restaurant and hotel complex, and the neighboring castle-style residence of Kadyrov.


While the election lends Kadyrov a veil of legitimacy, critics say he runs the republic as his own kingdom, ignoring federal laws.


 Well, he established peace.  So, that s fact.  So, that s no doubt,  says the Carnegie Moscow Center s Alexei Malashenko.   Chechen society, they paid a huge price for this stability,  he said.


Chechnya's stability will one day be tested, say analysts, when Putin is no longer in the Kremlin or Kadyrov is no longer in power.


Officials fear that day could come sooner if the hundreds of Islamist Chechens fighting in Syria try to bring their fight back home.

There s little chance that Orb n will be on the losing side in the national ballot he conceived and championed on the EU mandatory relocation plan, which would involve resettling only 1,294 asylum-seekers to Hungary.


According to opinion polls, at least two-thirds of the electorate will vote  no  to resettling any migrants sent their way by the European Union. Turnout is likely to be high as a result of Saturday s nail bomb explosion in the heart of Budapest, which seriously injured two police officers. It remains unclear, though, whether the bombing was the handiwork of a jihadist or far-right group.


A recent survey found that Hungarian sentiment has hardened dramatically in the past 12 months. Initially, when thousands of war refugees from the Middle East and economic migrants from Africa arrived in Hungary, marching up from the Balkans heading to Germany and other north European countries, Hungarians were welcoming, donating clothes and essentials to the new arrivals at Budapest s main railway station and in makeshift camps that popped up in the capital.


A year ago, 64 percent of Hungarians, according to a survey, acknowledged a moral obligation to assist asylum-seekers. A survey taken last week showed a dramatic reversal with 63 percent saying there was no obligation.


Orb n critics blame the government for the shift in sentiment, arguing he has been inciting xenophobia and that it is hardly surprising Hungarians have turned against migrants and view them as a threat.


John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's director for Europe, said,  against the backdrop of a toxic referendum campaign, poisonous anti-refugee rhetoric is reaching fever pitch.  On Tuesday, Amnesty issued a toughly worded report accusing Hungary of a  flagrant breach  of international law in how it is treating refugees.


Last month, Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, compared Orb n to right-wing populists, accusing them of peddling falsehoods. He said they  seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion, living peacefully in isolation, pilots of their fate, free of crime, foreign influence and war. A past that most certainly, in reality, did not exist anywhere, ever. 


The attacks on Orb n, though, appear to be having as little impact on Hungarians as the warnings foreign leaders issued, including U.S. President Barack Obama, to Britons ahead of their Brexit referendum in June. Some observers say they are in effect playing into Orb n s hands by building up popular resentment about foreign interference in domestic politics.


A large part of the appeal of Orb n s campaign rests with his argument that nations should determine their policies and not supra-national organizations. The Hungarian leader doesn t disguise his eagerness to roll back not only EU immigration policies, but a European Union status quo that he says is out of touch with popular opinion.","http://www.voanews.com/a/hungary-to-vote-against-refugee-resettlement-adding-to-eu-post-brexit-woes/3528076.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 00:00:24 -0400","Europe",""," "
"Putin's Chechnya Strongman Tightens Grip as Future Stability in Question","At a polling station in Chechnya s capital, Grozny, children in traditional costume danced to music as voters walked past to cast their ballots.


More a celebration than an exercise in democracy as Chechen voters for the first time elected strongman Ramzan Kadyrov.


Kadyrov was directly elected for the first time September 18 by a whopping 98 percent of voters, with 95 percent of the republic voting, according to official figures, tightening his grip on power in the north Caucasus region.  


The landslide win was predictable as Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya for a decade, appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, with almost total control over the republic.  


Grozny s mayor, Muslim Khuchiev, accompanied by an entourage in full Caucasus regalia, arrived in a horse-drawn carriage with flags bearing the image of Kadyrov and no doubt about who would win.   Everyone will vote unanimously,  he told VOA,  because they are voting not just for someone s seats in the Duma (parliament), not just for someone s seats in state bodies but, they are voting for their future. 




Personality cult


Kadyrov is seen by supporters as bringing peace and development to Chechnya, after two failed wars with Russia for independence, while critics say he has become a cult of personality.


Every major street in Grozny bears an image or reference to Ramzan Kadyrov, or his father Akhmad Kadyrov, and his face is often seen on car windows, T-shirts, and souvenirs.  


The government-controlled media covers his every move, lauding him as a  Hero of Russia , an award bestowed on him by Putin.  






 All the environment around us speaks for itself,  Kadyrov supporter Melizha Karnaeva tells VOA.   I think, I even know and I am sure, that this bright blue sky, that is thanks to Ramzan Kadyrov! 


A rebel like his father, they both switched sides to join Putin, who spent billions to rebuild Chechnya and prop up Kadyrov, who in return cracked down on militants and critics.


In Grozny, Kadyrov Prospekt runs past a modern mall and hotel and business complex  Grozny City  before passing the Akhmad Kadyrov mosque to merge with Putin Prospekt.  


Stability at  huge price 


In a nondescript apartment building on Putin Prospekt, activist Abdulla Duduev tells VOA the opposition Yabloko political party fielded candidates for the election, including himself, but did no campaigning in Chechnya out of fear opposition supporters would be persecuted.  


""We keep working in the regions,  he said.   What motivates this?  This is our Republic!  We were born here.  We can t be indifferent to what is happening here,  concludes Duduev.


Tight security is visible in the center of Grozny, especially around the mosque, known as the  Heart of Chechnya,  Grozny City restaurant and hotel complex, and the neighboring castle-style residence of Kadyrov.


While the election lends Kadyrov a veil of legitimacy, critics say he runs the republic as his own kingdom, ignoring federal laws.


 Well, he established peace.  So, that s fact.  So, that s no doubt,  says the Carnegie Moscow Center s Alexei Malashenko.   Chechen society, they paid a huge price for this stability,  he said.


Chechnya's stability will one day be tested, say analysts, when Putin is no longer in the Kremlin or Kadyrov is no longer in power.


Officials fear that day could come sooner if the hundreds of Islamist Chechens fighting in Syria try to bring their fight back home.

"US Airstrikes Take Out al-Shabab Commander in Somalia","U.S. military strikes near Kanjaron village on Monday killed four al-Shabab militants including a former commander, military sources tell VOA Somalia.


Airstrikes outside the village killed the former commander and three others


Somali military sources identified the former commander as Bashir Dhere, a former al-Shabab deputy militia commander in the Lower Jubba region.


Sources say he most recently operated in an Al-Shabab-controlled area west of Kismayo, though it is unclear where he ranked within the terror network.


In a statement, US AFRICOM said the four were killed in 'self-defense' airstrikes after extremists attacked Somali troops and their U.S. advisers outside the port of Kismayo.


The strikes took place in an area that has seen increased confrontations between Somali and AU forces supported by U.S. personnel.


AFRICOM insists the U.S. role is just advisory.

"ICC Sentences Islamist to 9 Years for Destroying Mali Shrines","In an unprecedented decision, the International Criminal Court Tuesday convicted a Muslim extremist of destroying centuries-old religious shrines in Mali.


It is the first time the Hague court has treated such destruction as a war crime, sentencing Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi to nine years in prison.


Al-Mahdi faced as much as 30 years in prison. But the court said it took into account his admission of guilt and regret, along with his plea to other Muslims not to do what he did.


Al-Mahdi was charged with overseeing the destruction of the centuries-old shrines with pickaxes and bulldozers in the ancient city of Timbuktu when Islamic extremists briefly seized control of northern Mali in 2012.


Timbuktu is a United Nations World Heritage site.


UNESCO chief Irina Bokova called the court's ruling against al-Mahdi a ""landmark in gaining recognition of the importance of heritage for humanity as a whole, and for the communities that have preserved it over the centuries.""


Timbuktu residents who watched the shrines being torn down also cheered. A tour guide told the French News Agency that ""justice has been served to our ancestors.""

"Shimon Peres' Life of Public Service Spanned the Life of Israel","Former Israeli President and Prime Minister Shimon Peres, whose life of public service spans the life of the Israeli nation itself, has died at age 93. 


Peres suffered a severe stroke two weeks ago and died Wednesday in the hospital in Tel HaShomer. 


He held nearly every major Israeli political post during his long career, including prime minister twice, the presidency, defense minister and foreign minister. 


He was the longest serving member of parliament in Israeli history, holding a seat in the Knesset for 48 years. 


Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Peres devoted his life to the sovereignty of the Israeli people.


""As a man of vision, his gaze was aimed to the future,"" he said.  ""As a man of security, he fortified Israel's strength in many ways, some of which even today is still unknown. As a man of peace, he worked until his final days toward reconciling with our neighbors for a better future for our children.""


U.S. President Barack Obama said no one did more than Peres to build the alliance between the United States and Israel and described him as a someone who forced people to expect more from themselves.


""He was guided by a vision of human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together.  He brought young people from around the world together because he knew they could carry us closer to our ideals of justice and equality,"" Obama said in a statement.




Former President Bill Clinton said that with the death of Peres, the Middle East ""has lost a fervent advocate for peace and reconciliation.""


Peres was born in present day Belarus in 1923 and moved to Israel when he was 11 years old, when the future Jewish state was under British mandate. 


He got his first taste of politics and diplomacy at age 23, when he was appointed to the Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. The congress was founded in 1897 to encourage Jewish emigration to Palestine. 


Peres became Israeli defense minister the first time in 1952, when he was just 29 years old. 


He is credited with working to develop Israel's defense and aerospace industries, and sources to buy modern weapons - which helped the newborn Jewish state survive. Peres also is said to have worked to develop Israel's nuclear program, which Israel has never confirmed having. 


The Israeli military was decimated by the 1973 Yom Kippur war and it was up to Peres, who again was serving as defense minister after several other posts, to rebuild Israel into a military powerhouse. 


While he was determined to make Israel as strong as ever, he was working behind the scenes for peace with Egypt. While rotating as prime minister with Yitzhak Shamir, Peres also worked to reduce tensions with Lebanon and Jordan. 


His major achievement was as foreign minister with the Oslo Accords -- a deal for Palestinian self-rule for which Peres, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize. 


Peres became prime minister a second time when Rabin was assassinated in 1995, but he lost reelection the following year. 


He was Israeli president from 2007 until 2014 -- a mainly ceremonial but important diplomatic post. 


Peres also founded the Peres Peace Center, which develops joint, economic, educational and cultural projects with the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan.

"Modi's 'Make in India' not enough to pip China, says top energy body","NEW DELHI: India is unlikely to replace China as the driver of global industrialization in the near future and the level of industrial investment in the country is lower than what is required to meet the ambitious  Make in India  initiative, according to the International Energy Agency. This comes despite the Modi government s major focus on economic reforms and efforts at boosting manufacturing activity.  In contrast with China, India s economy is continuing to grow strongly, a trend that is expected to persist through to 2020: Gross Domestic Product is projected to grow by between 7.5 per cent and 7.7 per cent per year up to 2020, according to IEA. The Modi government s Make in India campaign, launched in 2014, aims to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP from 17 per cent in 2013 to 25 per cent by 2020.   However, industrial investment currently falls short of what is required to achieve this target, suggesting that India will not replace China as the motor of global industrialisation in the near future,  the Paris-based agency said in its just-released World Energy Investment (WEI) 2016 report. India's industrial output fell 2.4 per cent in July after a spurt in May and June, mostly due to a decline in manufacturing output. The slowdown in industrial activity does not bode well for Asia's third largest economy, especially after overall GDP growth faltered to a 15-month low between April and June.  The 177-page IEA report, reviewed by ETEnergyWorld, also states that Indian coal production continues to be supported by strong investment, unlike the rest of the world where coal demand has declined largely because of China and the US.  Rapid growth in electricity demand, as well as energy security and cost considerations, are continuing to drive large investments in coal-fired capacity in India and the region of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),  the report says.  Globally, coal investment jumped from around $30 billion in 2000 to $90 billion in 2012. However, 2015 witnessed a reduction in global coal investment due to slowing coal consumption in China and the United States   the two biggest markets   coupled with ample supply capacity and a deteriorating outlook for demand due to weaker economic prospects in China and tougher environmental policies.  The main exception was India, where government programmes are expected to push coal demand higher,  the report, published earlier this month, said.  India s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had on Monday said in her speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) India will play a leading role in combating climate change. According to the report, long-term contracts are helping to mobilise investment in renewables in emerging markets like India, but difficulties in upgrading the grid in order to integrate them into the system persist.  The report notes the Indian government s  round-the-clock energy for all  and  Make in India  policies are helping to push up coal demand, with the majority of new coal supplies coming from domestic production. The government is targeting 1.5 billion tonnes of output by 2020. Investment by coal producers, especially state-owned Coal India, which accounts for 80 per cent of the country s production, is rising accordingly. Coal India increased capital expenditure in coal mining by around 20 per cent to over $800 million in 2015 and plans to spend even more in 2016, it said.  The Modi government is working on a target to increase the country's renewable energy capacity over 5 times from 32,000 Mw in 2014 to 175,000 Mw by 2022 -- the largest renewable energy expansion programme in the world. As part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) on climate change by 2030, the government has committed to reduce emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 per cent over 2005 levels and achieve 40 per cent installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy sources. Renewables currently account for 15 per cent of the country's total power capacity of 3 lakh Mw.  IEA has also pointed at less healthy financial indicators for power companies in India stating that stagnant cash flows and falling capital expenditures reflect the increased risk of not being able to recover investments.  Retail electricity tariffs are not always high enough to fully cover costs and some state Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) companies continue to face severe financial problems, undermining the reliability of the network and the ability of generators to sell their output,  the report states.  Significantly, the study notes how renewable investment in India increased by over 20 per cent to just under $10 billion in 2015 -- with hydro power accounting for one-quarter of the total   but uncertainties remain over the deliverability of some low solar PV bids, the regulatory framework and how new projects will be integrated in the electricity system given the financial health of the state distribution companies and needed grid investment.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-will-not-replace-china-as-the-motor-of-industrialization-in-near-future-international-energy-agency/articleshow/54561018.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 08:34:11 GMT","NA",""," "
"Waitlisted? Don't worry, railways plans to get you a confirmed train ride soon","BENGALURU: Railway authorities have plans to introduce shadow trains in high-demand sectors such as Bengaluru-Chennai, Bengaluru-Ernakulam, Bengaluru-Howrah and Bengaluru-Belgaum.  The idea, however, is still in discussion stage and will take wings only after the Railways is able to overcome the bottlenecks.  Shadow trains are those that follow the main trains after a gap of 15 to 30 minutes. For example, Kanyakumari Express or Shatabdi Express are always full, so railways can introduce trains that closely follow these trains. By doing this, the Railways -besides dealing with rising demand -can also earn some revenue.  ""We will identify the sectors that are regularly full. But we can implement this idea only after the availability of the path and the coaches improve,"" said a railway official. ""We will need double lines, less congestion and better infrastructure,"" he added.    The Railways does not want to lose passengers, especially those booked on the AC coaches. Though small in number, they make up a substantial portion of passenger revenues, and the Railways has been exploring ways to retain this revenue.  It is precisely for this reason that the Railways introduced the alternative train accommodation scheme under the name Vikalp. It provides for alternative accommodation for passengers on tickets booked through the IRCTC site. If a traveller has booked a ticket on the Rajdhani and is waitlisted, the Railways will try to accommodate the passenger on another train running to the same destination on the same day .  First introduced on Delhi-Lucknow and Delhi-Jammu, the facility is now available on Bengaluru-Delhi route too. Vikalp is currently run as a pilot project, and authorities said they will soon be able to extend it to other high demand sectors from Bengaluru. Vikalp, the official explained, was introduced to provide confirmed accommodation to waitlisted passengers by using up every available seat as it is illegal for them to board reserved coaches. Under the scheme, the authorities are augmenting the sector capacity either by attaching additional coaches to clear waitlisted passengers or by running extra trains.  ""The facility is available only on e-ticketing option. This is not yet open on all the sectors, which we will do as we go along. This requires a lot of tweaking of the software in the reservation system,"" the official said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/waitlisted-like-irctcs-vikalp-you-can-hope-to-board-shadow-outbound-trains/articleshow/54558661.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 08:26:45 GMT","NA",""," "
"Pakistan knocks on World Bank's door to stop India from exploiting water treaty","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan today approached the World Bank amid reports that India could revoke the 56-year- old Indus Water Treaty, with senior Pakistani officials taking up the matter with the international lender which had mediated the water-sharing deal.  A delegation of the Government of Pakistan led by the Attorney General for Pakistan, Ashtar Ausaf Ali, met with senior officials of the World Bank at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington DC, to discuss matters relating to Pakistan's recent Request for Arbitration given to India pursuant to Article IX of the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960, Geo News reported.  The report also said Pakistan approached the International Court of Justice, but did not provide any details.  On 19 August, Pakistan had formally requested India for settlement of outstanding disputes pertaining to India's construction of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants on rivers Neelum and Chenab respectively, by referring the matters to the Court of Arbitration as provided in Article IX of the Treaty.  Under the treaty, the World Bank has an important role in establishment of the Court of Arbitration by facilitating the process of appointment of three judges, called Umpires, to the Court, while each country appoints two arbitrators.  The Pakistani officials met with senior officials of the World Bank to insist on early appointment of the judges and empanelment the court, it said.  The Pakistani delegation consisted of Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf Ali; Secretary, Ministry of Water & Power, Muhammad Younus Dagha; Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters, Mirza Asif Baig and others, it said.  Pakistan's Ambassador to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani and World Bank's Executive Director for Pakistan Nasir Khosa were also present.  In the meeting with the Pakistani delegation, the World Bank committed itself to timely fulfilling its obligations under the treaty while remaining neutral, the report said.  Under the treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan President Ayub Khan in September 1960, waters of six rivers - Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - were to be shared between the two countries.  The treaty provides specific design criteria for any hydro-electric power plants to be built by India. Pakistan has held the position the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants violate the design parameters of the treaty.  Earlier, Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs and Security, Sartaj Aziz said an attempt by India to block Pakistan's water could be seen as ""an act of war.""  Yesterday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with officials to review provisions of the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.  In that meeting it was decided that India will ""exploit to the maximum"" the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum, as per the water-sharing pact.  The meeting came as India weighed its options to hit back at Pakistan in the aftermath of the Uri terror attack that left 18 soldiers dead, triggering demands that the government scrap the water-sharing deal to mount pressure on the country.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pakistan-approaches-world-bank-over-indus-treaty/articleshow/54559907.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 09:11:18 GMT","NA",""," "

"BPTP in talks to sell Gurgaon land to Godrej Properties","BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Real estate developer BPTP is in the process of selling its land parcel in Gurgaon to Godrej Properties. The 20-acre land along the Dwarka Expressway is valued at around Rs 350 crore, said two persons familiar with the development. ""Both the companies are in the final stages of the deal,"" said one of the persons with direct knowledge of the transaction.  BPTP is likely to utilise a part of the money received from the land sale to repay JP Morgan Chase as settlement in a dispute over the bank exiting from its investment in the company. ""Some part of the money will be paid to Citi too,"" said another person who did not want to be named. This is also one of the few transactions where Godrej Properties is buying land parcel on outright basis for project development.  The real estate development arm of Godrej Group usually prefers to enter into joint development agreements to undertake projects than buying plots on outright basis.  An email query to BPTP remained unanswered until going to press. Godrej Properties responded to query saying, ""As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on market speculation.""  Godrej Properties is currently developing residential, commercial and township projects spread across around 128 million square feet in 12 cities in India.  Earlier this year, Godrej Properties forayed into the Noida market with a development management agreement to build a housing project on a 36-acre plot.  While this is Godrej Properties' first project in Noida, it is its sixth in the National Capital Region (NCR).  Last year, BPTP agreed to buy out CPI's shareholding for Rs 333 crore and JP Morgan's shareholding for Rs 360 crore payable over a period of time. In 2006, BPTP raised Rs 322 crore from CPI India, a Citigroup fund, now managed by Apollo Management, by selling 5.67% equity stake in the company.  In 2008-09, the realtor further raised Rs 241 crore in two rounds of funding from a subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase group of companies by selling 6.21% stake.  BPTP is also in the process of selling a 25-acre land parcel in Hyderabad for Rs 250 crore to retire old debts. The company plans to sell some of the noncore assets to raise funds for meeting business requirements, said one of the persons mentioned above.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/bptp-in-talks-to-sell-gurgaon-land-to-godrej-properties/articleshow/54399987.cms","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:24:16 GMT","NA",""," "
"Teva Pharmaceutical inks largest realty deal for HQ at Goregaon","MUMBAI: The world's largest generic pharmaceutical company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, has inked a deal for 1.25 lakh sq ft office space for lease in Oberoi Realty's commercial complex Commerz II in Goregaon suburb of Mumbai in the largest transaction for headquarters by any company, said three persons familiar with the development.  ""The transaction was concluded recently and the company will start operating from the new premise in the next twothree months. The design and fit-out work will commence soon,"" said one of the persons mentioned above.  The Israeli multinational pharmaceutical company will be shifting its India headquarters and consolidating six offices in Mumbai in this newly leased space, spread over four floors. The New York Stock Exchange-listed firm's current India headquarter operations are split into two-three office buildings in the Powai suburb of Mumbai.    The drug-maker will be paying Rs 140-145 per sq ft per month for the space. Teva has leased the front-office space for five years and rentals will be escalated after three years.  Teva will be paying close to Rs 22 crore as rentals every year for the next three years. Rent will be reset for the next two years after that.  The transaction assumes significance as the space is being picked up for the company's headquarters and that too in Goregaon, not in any of the metro's business districts.  ""We are delighted that Teva Pharmaceuticals has chosen Commerz II, our commercial building and part of Oberoi Garden City, for their India headquarters. Convenient location off the Western Express Highway and the proposed metro for easy connectivity between north-south corridor of Mumbai has aided the response to Commerz II,"" said Vikas Oberoi, CMD, Oberoi Realty, confirming the transaction.  Email queries to Teva remained unanswered until the time of going to press. Transaction advisor JLL India declined to offer a comment for the story.  The transaction shows that the commercial property market in the country's commercial capital continues to be robust. Low vacancy levels across office complexes and lack of new commercial space being ready to move are contributing to the rents firming up. Vacancy levels in other commercial complexes in the vicinity along Western Express Highway including Nirlon Knowledge Park and Nesco are currently close to zero.  Since 2015, office space absorption across major Indian property markets has been growing on the back of a combination of lower rents and a positive economic outlook, which makes it certain that the recovery, this time, is more sustainable and long-term in comparison with 2011.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/teva-pharmaceutical-inks-largest-realty-deal-for-hq-at-goregaon/articleshow/54399935.cms","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:18:27 GMT","NA",""," "
"Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital drags Neelkanth township, promoter to NCLT","Private equity fund Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital (UIVC), floated by Anand Jain's Jai Corp with Reliance Industries (RIL) as an anchor investor, has filed a petition in The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Neelkanth Township & Construction and its promoter Bhavik Bhimjyani.  The petition has accused the Mumbai-based builder of misappropriation of funds, creation of fraudulent accounts, mismanagement of the company and defaulting on loans and commitments in its Alibaug residential township project. However, Bhimjyani denies these allegations. He said that the fund didn't bring in Rs 200-crore capital that was committed, leading to the project's delay.   Right from the date of investment in Neelkanth in 2007, UIVC has had its nominees on the Neelkanth board and has been aware of the activities, decisions and transactions in Neelkanth,  Bhavik Bhimjyani said in an email response. An email sent to UIVC remained unanswered until the time of going to press.  The fund also counts Bhimjyani's relatives Tulsi Bhimjyani and Anshul Bhimjyani as respondents.But Tulsi Bhimjyani responded that he and his family are neither directors nor shareholders.  The petition has alleged that Bhimjyani held illegal meetings without notifying the fund and tried to take control of the board by in creasing the number of nomineedirectors to 10 from two.  In 2007, UIVC had invested Rs 50 lakh as equity for a 40% stake in Neelkanth Township & Construction, while the promoters invested Rs 75 lakh for the remaining 60%. The fund also invested Rs 51 crore through debentures. Neelkanth Township was looking to acquire about 150 acres of land in Alibaug, near Mumbai, to develop a project to build bungalows.  In 2007-2008, UIVC had invested in two projects -Alibaug and Pune --through debentures and equity. The petition says that the builder's loan and interest repayment defaults would cumulatively amount to Rs 200 crore since 2010-11.  UIVC has also filed an application in the Bombay HC to appoint an arbitrator for its ongoing disputes.  The petition also points out that UIVC found out in August 2015 that Neelkanth Township, at the instance of the promoters, had paid Rs 5.27 crore as advance to another promoter-group company --Lighthouse Developers. The advance was paid for purported acquisition of land without indication of any location, price or area. Further, it mentions that this sum was used by Lighthouse Developers to repay the promoters' loan and not for buying land.  However, according to Bhimjyani, there is no illegal or unfair conduct either at the board or general body meetings of Neelkanth under the current management. His emailed response says, ""There has been no misappropriation of funds or creation of any fraudulent accounts or related party transactions. Allegations of non-supply of accounts   belatedly made   are false.""  According to Bhimjyani, the nominees of UIVC had not attended any board or general body meeting of Neelkanth between 2011 and 2015.From 2007, the fund hasn't made any allegations of non-receipt of notice, either of the board or of the general body meeting of Neelkanth and were made for the first time in 2015, close to the fund's expiry date.  Both parties had also held meetings between 2011 and 2012 for settlement of the issue through mediation of a large business house. However, the settlement could not be reached as the promoters of Neelkanth reneged from the terms agreed during these meetings.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/urban-infrastructure-venture-capital-dragsneelkanthtownship-promoter-tonclt/articleshow/54560125.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 06:50:52 GMT","NA",""," "
"Hindustan Copper to invest Rs 2,000 crore in new project","KOLKATA: State-run Hindustan Copper is expected to shortly seek Cabinet approval to invest Rs 2,200 crore in a new project to extract copper using a technology that is being tried out on a commercial scale for the first time globally.  The project is part of theRs 6,000 crore capital expenditure that the country s largest integrated copper producer has planned through 2021-22. The project is slated to come up at Chhattisgarh s copperrich Rajnandgaon district, adjacent to HCL s existing mine at Malanjkhand in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.   We hope to produce 1 lakh tonnes of copper cathode from this new project every year. With copper demand in India set to grow 8-9% annually, we hope to be able to add new capacity in tune with market growth,  Chairman KD Diwan said. He was speaking after the company s board meeting. The project will boost HCL s current 31,000 tonne cathode capacity by nearly threefold.  We hope to get government approval for the project within the next six months,  he said.  The project will involve hydrometallurgy, a method for obtaining metals from their ores through leaching. The technology will facilitate extraction of copper from sulphide ores prevalent in the country.  HCL will also be able to produce silver and gold as by-products. The company has shortlisted two possible technology partners, including an Israeli company, that are expected to bid for the job.  HCL is also gearing up to invest nearly Rs 100 crore to achieve full capacity at Jhagadia Copper Ltd (JCL), a company it acquired from Asset Reconstruction Company of India (ARCIL) for Rs 210 crore in Gujarat. The newly acquired unit, now renamed Gujarat Copper Project, has been revived and has started commercial production. HCL hopes to have installed copper cathode capacity of 50,000 tonnes next year.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/hindustan-copper-to-invest-rs-2000-crore-in-new-project/articleshow/54556076.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 02:34:53 GMT","NA",""," "
"Want to know which all stocks have turned expensive? Try this formula","NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market saw a meteoric rise in the last 6-7 month, thanks to the loose money policies adopted by several central banks the world over, which eased liquidity conditions and fuelled a smart rally in individual stocks which are now looking slightly expensive.  Equity benchmark Sensex has rallied over 26 per cent from its 52-week low of 22,494 and a little over 7 per cent in last three months. It has risen about 8 per cent so far in 2016 compared with a 52 per cent rally seen in the shares of PVR, 33 per cent in Tata Motors and about 11 per cent in SBI in the same period.  Some of the stocks are looking expensive and have already seen a fair bit of correction, but there could be more room for further downside as the June quarter earnings failed to cheer investors, experts said.   The current round of consolidation in the market has been due to global factors and any cue on stabilisation will bring cheer to the market. At the same time, we also find stocks where valuations have moved above historical averages, but subdued June quarter results have not left any room for further pickup in valuations,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit BNP Paribas, told ETMarkets.com.   We believe stocks like PVR, Tata Motors, ONGC, Axis Bank, Jubilant FoodWorks and NTPC have expanded beyond the recent improvement in financials, i.e. growth in price has been more than requisite,  he said.    Which are the expensive stocks?  Stocks that have either seen a strong runup in prices or are trading ahead of their fundamentals owing to any positive news flow could be trading in the high-valuation zone.  In simple terms, irrespective of quality or credentials, any stock can be considered expensive if valuation has moved substantially above historical averages and the future outlook does not offer any material upside.   For example, we did see stocks in pockets such as PSU banks and levered infrastructure players run up sharply in the current market rally. But, these segments continue to be plagued by NPAs and stretched balance sheets respectively,  Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICI Securities, told ETMarkets.com.   Therefore, the above-mentioned stocks can see huge swings as they do not merit a place in your portfolio given their hazy fundamental outlook,  he said.  How to identify expensive stocks?  Generally, investors sell off a stock, terming it as expensive, when the price goes up substantially. However, that may not be true, experts said.  If underlying earnings rise significantly, an astronomical rise in a stock is all but natural. Investors should sell a stock only when it becomes expensive and not because of daily price movement or correction in the market.  Investors can identify an expensive stock two ways. First, they should do a comparison for last 10 years on various valuation parameters such as PE and PB ratios.   For example, if the highest and lowest PE levels of a stock in last 10 years have been 30 and 15, those should be considered the benchmarks for higher and lower valuation multiples,  Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities, told ETMarkets.com.   If the stock is currently trading at the higher end of the multiple, then the stock is expensive,  he said.  The second way is to compare the valuation parameters with that of respective industry multiples.  If the stock is quoting at a multiple above industry average, then there is an opportunity to encash the premium valuation, provided the same kind of premium valuation was not available in the past,  Modi said.  ""However, the above factors are based purely on quantitative numbers. Many a time, qualitative aspects should also be looked at before taking the call to sell a stock,  he said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/want-to-know-which-all-stocks-have-turned-expensive-try-this-formula/articleshow/54558461.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 05:59:04 GMT","NA",""," "

"My first year at work - 'I respected my time, indulged in cycling & photography'","Yogesh Agarwal Cofounder at CareOnGo as told to Prachi Verma Dadhwal  The brief I was given and what I did in the first 100 days at work In my first job, which was at Deloitte, I was tasked with finding process gaps in the inventory management. Though the job in itself was daunting, I couldn't stop at a single task. While understanding the process inefficiencies, I got pulled along into the entire process right from manufacturing to warehousing to stocking-giving me the entire picture to find the exact gaps. I worked closely with various health clients in the US and Europe, and while analysing the processes, I found a lot of inefficiency which could be improved.  The worst mistake I made With the initial fire of working in such a big project, I started doing extensive research by myself. After a few days of getting exhausted by it, I realised that this should have been first discussed with the team to get a picture of the challenges they faced.  The best leadership lessons I learnt As andrew carnegie said, ""No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself, or get all the credit for doing it."" I learnt pretty early that both teamwork and leadership are instrumental for a small company's success and it is the combined efforts of individual minds that can result in creating something unprecedented. On starting my venture with co-founders, I have tried to incorporate the same values in welcoming out-of-the-box ideas from other employees at work and collectively achieving the targets.  How I had fun at work Communication is a huge stress buster for me, and during late hours spent at office I started engaging in discussions-be it complex business problems or personal hurdles-with my colleague. This was to understand different mindsets.  How I managed my work-life balance I respected my ""me"" time and indulged in activities I am zealous about--cycling and photography.  Apart from meeting goals at work, I made sure I set personal goals the same way, which is why I took up adventure sports like skiing and mountain biking. I believe in striking a balance between work and play, alongside pushing myself to take up challenging activities for that adrenaline rush.  My biggest innovation My tryst was in identifying the gaps in the operational processes to maintain stock. After brainstorming with the team, I devised an algorithm which could increase the efficiency in inventory management by 23% and reduce manpower by 15%.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/my-first-year-at-work-i-respected-my-time-indulged-in-cycling-photography/articleshow/54477054.cms","Fri, 23 Sep 2016 06:10:06 GMT","NA",""," "

"Chinese Coal Mine Explosion Kills 18","A gas explosion at a Chinese coal mine has left at least 18 people dead and two more missing after what Chinese officials are calling  illegal  mining activities.


The gas explosion occurred Tuesday morning at a small coal mine in the northwestern Chinese city of Shizuishan as 20 miners were working underground, Chinese state media reported.


Xinhua cited an initial investigation in blaming illegal mining for the explosion, though the state media outlet did not provide further details.


During a news conference Wednesday, local officials said representatives from Linli Coal Mining Co. Ltd., which owns the mine, had been taken into police custody.


Wu Yuguo, vice mayor of Shizuishan City, said heavy gas concentrations and the collapse of the mine shaft had created difficulties for rescue workers.


Despite the dangerous conditions, firefighters and coal mine rescue specialists continued their search for the two missing mine workers Wednesday.


China has made great strides in improving mine safety, but its mines are still the deadliest in the world.


Accidents at Chinese mines routinely make national news, though they continue to happen as bosses disregard safety standards in the quest for higher profits.


Official government figures put the annual number of mining related deaths in China at less than 1,000, but rights groups claim the numbers are underreported and are actually much higher.","http://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-coal-mine-explosion/3528197.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 04:47:57 -0400","Asia",""," "

"US Nuclear Weapons Systems Need an Upgrade","At Sandia National Laboratories inside Kirtland Air Force Base, nuclear weapons equipment is spun around, smashed and even blown up--all to help the U.S. military modernize its nuclear weapons stockpile.


Nuclear weapons are essential for US defense


Speaking at the base Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter told troops that the nuclear mission is the  bedrock of American security. 


The U.S. can deter a nuclear attack in three ways: by land with intercontinental ballistic missiles, by air with nuclear weapons on bombers and fighter jets, and by sea with nuclear missiles roaming the oceans on submarines. These methods are more commonly known as the  nuclear triad. 


Update is necessary


But all of the programs are entering an age where they need to be modernized. 


The last B-52H bomber aircraft rolled off the production line in 1952. New B61-12 nuclear bombs currently being developed at Sandia are updating tube technology dating back several decades, but they won t be ready until 2020.







Outdated computer systems


William Schneider, President of International Planning Services and Former Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, says the expansive land-based Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) system was produced in the 1970s and is in need of a complete makeover. 


 As a benchmark of their ancient character, they still use floppy disks and computers that would be relics in any other setting apart from this,  Schneider told VOA.


And the most survivable leg of the nuclear triad, the Ohio-class submarine, has had its life extended from 30 years to 42 years and will start to age out in the next decade.


Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan took attention away


Years of underfunding and a lack of attention have raised questions about how reliable and safe the United States  most dangerous weapon will be if more action is not taken soon.


 If we re going to maintain a safe, secure, and effective force, we re going to need to do something to replace the existing delivery systems and extend the life of the nuclear weapons that we have,  Frank Klotz, the U.S. Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security, said at a recent nuclear talk hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.


While in New Mexico, Carter echoed the need to modernize all three legs of the triad and placed the blame for years of delay on being  preoccupied  in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he called  understandable. 


US trailing Russia and China


The delay has put the U.S. nuclear modernization program 20 years behind the Chinese and Russian modernization programs, according to Schneider.


 That in itself is a source of instability and something that we need to correct,  he said.


The U.S. military's top deterrent is up for a $108 billion makeover planned over the next five years. However, budget squabbles in Congress have continued to threaten the stability of future modernization plans.","http://www.voanews.com/a/us-nuclear-weapons-systems-need-an-upgrade/3528193.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 03:34:42 -0400","USA",""," "
"Malawi Girls Learn Self Defense Tactics Against Sexual Abuse","Schoolgirls in Malawi are learning what to do if someone tries to attack them. A Kenyan NGO started the training in response to a recent study that showed one in five girls under the age of 18 in Malawi has been sexually assaulted.


At a school in the Salima district of central Malawi, girls are practicing punches and jabs. But this is not a martial arts class. These girls are learning how to defend themselves.


 The curriculum involves both verbal and physical skills. Physical skill is used when it is the best and last option, meaning that we use mainly verbal skills which is how to use their voices to [prevent] the assaults,  said Loveness Thole, the Ujamaa curriculum coordinator.


The girls learn to shout for help or pretend they see someone coming to fool their attacker. They also learn techniques to disable the attacker so they can run for safety.







Instructors from the charity Ujamaa Pamodzi Africa have been conducting these weekly, two-hour lessons at schools in seven districts around Malawi.


 By the end, we would like to reduce the incidents of rape. We would also like to promote education by reducing early marriages, school drop-outs and also early pregnancies,  said Simang aliso Domoya, Ujamma project coordinator.


The U.N. Children s Fund is financing the program. So far, 25,000 girls have taken part.


Teachers like Rebecca Msalanyama say the Ujamaa interventions have removed some of the stigma around sexual assault.


 In the past, girls were not reporting it but now they are indeed empowered to report abuses. Some are reporting the incidents to us teachers and others to their parents for action,  she said.







Some girls, such as student Shang Chituzu, said they have already had to use their skills.


 My uncle ordered me to lie on his bed. When I asked why, he started touching my body. I told him to stop and that I will report him to police or my mother if he continues. After hearing this, he ordered me out of his room,  said Chituzu.


The Ujamaa project is also teaching boys about respecting girls and teaching them how to intervene if they see a girl being assaulted.


Funds permitting, project organizers say they want to extend the self-defense program to students nationwide.","http://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-girls-learn-self-defense-tactics-against-sexual-abuse/3528174.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 02:55:07 -0400","Africa",""," "
"US Presidential Candidates Take Debate Critiques to Supporters","With election day six weeks away, U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Tuesday and gave critical reviews of each other's performance in their first head-to-head debate.


Many independent analysts said Clinton won Monday's debate and could get a boost in national polls that showed her a few points ahead of Trump.


Trump lacked details


Speaking to supporters in North Carolina, Clinton cast her opponent as lacking details during the debate.


""I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president.  And you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do,"" she said.


Trump says he won


Trump said after the debate that he won, and at a rally Tuesday night in Florida suggested he could have done even better.


""For 90 minutes, I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back.  I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her,"" he said.


The two candidates will debate twice more before the November 8 vote, the next coming on October 9.




Clinton could pick up points


Political scientist Alan Abramowitz of Emory University in Atlanta and poll analyst Nate Silver both said Clinton could add another two points to her edge after she kept Trump on the defensive through much of the first debate, attacking him for refusing to release his U.S. income tax returns, for failing to pay some contractors he hired to build his golf courses and casinos, and for his lengthy history of slurs against women.


""I wouldn't be surprised if her poll numbers move up a little,"" Abramowitz told VOA. ""I think it might go up a couple points. I think it makes it a little more difficult for Trump,"" the Republican nominee, to reach a majority in the Electoral College where U.S. presidential elections are decided based on state-by-state results rather than the national popular vote.


He called Clinton's debate performance ""calm, cool and collected,"" and said she was ""able to talk about the issues."" He described Trump as ""rather bombastic and superficial. I think he got in a lot of trouble on race and gender issues.""


Trump needs practice


Emory professor Andra Gillespie said, ""I think his campaign will try to regroup and he might practice a little bit more before the next debate as opposed to bragging about how he may not have been practicing going into the (Monday) debate.""


Silver, who runs the fivethirtyeight.com election prediction Website, wrote that the contrast between Clinton, seeking to become the country's first female president, and Trump ""might be expected to produce a swing of 2 to 4 percentage points in the horse race polls"" in her favor.

"Hungary to Reject Refugee Resettlement, Adding to EU s Post-Brexit Woes","There s been nothing subtle about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s campaign before Sunday s nationwide referendum on whether Hungary should agree to accept migrants under the European Union refugee resettlement plan.



Facts have been dispensed with, allege critics, and the government s language has been so abrasive about asylum-seekers, who have been portrayed as being synonymous with terrorists and criminals, that Luxembourg s foreign minister suggested earlier this month that Hungary ought to be thrown out of the EU.


Not that criticism is deterring Orb n, a liberal-turned-nationalist conservative who relishes controversy and is surfing a powerful wave of central European populism that may end up reshaping the regional bloc, taking power away from EU institutions in Brussels and placing it back in the hands of national governments.


At a fractious migration crisis summit of European leaders in Vienna a few days ago, Orb n, who along with other central European and Balkan leaders have tightened their borders to asylum-seekers, warned any new massive surge would swamp Europe.


 When the migrants descend on us and trouble arrives, it will be too late to reach for blueprints, for fences, for physical barriers, for new police and soldiers,  he cautioned.


Orb n and his ministers deny allegations of racism and say their referendum campaigning has been strictly factual. They defend posters and leaflets depicting claimed ""no go"" zones across the continent that the government alleges have become perilous for locals because of violent immigrants.


While insisting the map is based on crime statistics, Orb n spokesman Zolt n Kov cs acknowledged recently,  The picture is a bit disproportionate.  That was rare backtracking in a referendum campaign that s likely to increase divisions among European governments about how to cope with the migration crisis that has been roiling the continent for two years.


Orb n has predicted the referendum will have a domino effect with other European governments and follow Budapest s example, especially Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Like Hungary, they are in the four-nation Visegrad Group of central European countries which have been the strongest critics of EU migrant policies and are overwhelmingly white and Christian.


An earlier incarnation of an EU refugee-burden sharing plan floundered amid objections with just a few hundred asylum-seekers being resettled; but, Eurocrats in Brussels insist a renewed version will start as soon as December. 


There s little chance that Orb n will be on the losing side in the national ballot he conceived and championed on the EU mandatory relocation plan, which would involve resettling only 1,294 asylum-seekers to Hungary.


According to opinion polls, at least two-thirds of the electorate will vote  no  to resettling any migrants sent their way by the European Union. Turnout is likely to be high as a result of Saturday s nail bomb explosion in the heart of Budapest, which seriously injured two police officers. It remains unclear, though, whether the bombing was the handiwork of a jihadist or far-right group.


A recent survey found that Hungarian sentiment has hardened dramatically in the past 12 months. Initially, when thousands of war refugees from the Middle East and economic migrants from Africa arrived in Hungary, marching up from the Balkans heading to Germany and other north European countries, Hungarians were welcoming, donating clothes and essentials to the new arrivals at Budapest s main railway station and in makeshift camps that popped up in the capital.


A year ago, 64 percent of Hungarians, according to a survey, acknowledged a moral obligation to assist asylum-seekers. A survey taken last week showed a dramatic reversal with 63 percent saying there was no obligation.


Orb n critics blame the government for the shift in sentiment, arguing he has been inciting xenophobia and that it is hardly surprising Hungarians have turned against migrants and view them as a threat.


John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's director for Europe, said,  against the backdrop of a toxic referendum campaign, poisonous anti-refugee rhetoric is reaching fever pitch.  On Tuesday, Amnesty issued a toughly worded report accusing Hungary of a  flagrant breach  of international law in how it is treating refugees.


Last month, Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, compared Orb n to right-wing populists, accusing them of peddling falsehoods. He said they  seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion, living peacefully in isolation, pilots of their fate, free of crime, foreign influence and war. A past that most certainly, in reality, did not exist anywhere, ever. 


The attacks on Orb n, though, appear to be having as little impact on Hungarians as the warnings foreign leaders issued, including U.S. President Barack Obama, to Britons ahead of their Brexit referendum in June. Some observers say they are in effect playing into Orb n s hands by building up popular resentment about foreign interference in domestic politics.


A large part of the appeal of Orb n s campaign rests with his argument that nations should determine their policies and not supra-national organizations. The Hungarian leader doesn t disguise his eagerness to roll back not only EU immigration policies, but a European Union status quo that he says is out of touch with popular opinion.","http://www.voanews.com/a/hungary-to-vote-against-refugee-resettlement-adding-to-eu-post-brexit-woes/3528076.html","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 00:00:24 -0400","Europe",""," "
"Putin's Chechnya Strongman Tightens Grip as Future Stability in Question","At a polling station in Chechnya s capital, Grozny, children in traditional costume danced to music as voters walked past to cast their ballots.


More a celebration than an exercise in democracy as Chechen voters for the first time elected strongman Ramzan Kadyrov.


Kadyrov was directly elected for the first time September 18 by a whopping 98 percent of voters, with 95 percent of the republic voting, according to official figures, tightening his grip on power in the north Caucasus region.  


The landslide win was predictable as Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya for a decade, appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, with almost total control over the republic.  


Grozny s mayor, Muslim Khuchiev, accompanied by an entourage in full Caucasus regalia, arrived in a horse-drawn carriage with flags bearing the image of Kadyrov and no doubt about who would win.   Everyone will vote unanimously,  he told VOA,  because they are voting not just for someone s seats in the Duma (parliament), not just for someone s seats in state bodies but, they are voting for their future. 




Personality cult


Kadyrov is seen by supporters as bringing peace and development to Chechnya, after two failed wars with Russia for independence, while critics say he has become a cult of personality.


Every major street in Grozny bears an image or reference to Ramzan Kadyrov, or his father Akhmad Kadyrov, and his face is often seen on car windows, T-shirts, and souvenirs.  


The government-controlled media covers his every move, lauding him as a  Hero of Russia , an award bestowed on him by Putin.  






 All the environment around us speaks for itself,  Kadyrov supporter Melizha Karnaeva tells VOA.   I think, I even know and I am sure, that this bright blue sky, that is thanks to Ramzan Kadyrov! 


A rebel like his father, they both switched sides to join Putin, who spent billions to rebuild Chechnya and prop up Kadyrov, who in return cracked down on militants and critics.


In Grozny, Kadyrov Prospekt runs past a modern mall and hotel and business complex  Grozny City  before passing the Akhmad Kadyrov mosque to merge with Putin Prospekt.  


Stability at  huge price 


In a nondescript apartment building on Putin Prospekt, activist Abdulla Duduev tells VOA the opposition Yabloko political party fielded candidates for the election, including himself, but did no campaigning in Chechnya out of fear opposition supporters would be persecuted.  


""We keep working in the regions,  he said.   What motivates this?  This is our Republic!  We were born here.  We can t be indifferent to what is happening here,  concludes Duduev.


Tight security is visible in the center of Grozny, especially around the mosque, known as the  Heart of Chechnya,  Grozny City restaurant and hotel complex, and the neighboring castle-style residence of Kadyrov.


While the election lends Kadyrov a veil of legitimacy, critics say he runs the republic as his own kingdom, ignoring federal laws.


 Well, he established peace.  So, that s fact.  So, that s no doubt,  says the Carnegie Moscow Center s Alexei Malashenko.   Chechen society, they paid a huge price for this stability,  he said.


Chechnya's stability will one day be tested, say analysts, when Putin is no longer in the Kremlin or Kadyrov is no longer in power.


Officials fear that day could come sooner if the hundreds of Islamist Chechens fighting in Syria try to bring their fight back home.

"US Airstrikes Take Out al-Shabab Commander in Somalia","U.S. military strikes near Kanjaron village on Monday killed four al-Shabab militants including a former commander, military sources tell VOA Somalia.


Airstrikes outside the village killed the former commander and three others


Somali military sources identified the former commander as Bashir Dhere, a former al-Shabab deputy militia commander in the Lower Jubba region.


Sources say he most recently operated in an Al-Shabab-controlled area west of Kismayo, though it is unclear where he ranked within the terror network.


In a statement, US AFRICOM said the four were killed in 'self-defense' airstrikes after extremists attacked Somali troops and their U.S. advisers outside the port of Kismayo.


The strikes took place in an area that has seen increased confrontations between Somali and AU forces supported by U.S. personnel.


AFRICOM insists the U.S. role is just advisory.


Recent operations in the area appear to be an effort aimed at giving Somali, AU forces a real practical experience in carrying out and fighting commando operations against militant forces, military sources say.


These operations targeted taxation checkpoints and lower profile al-Shabab militants.","http://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-take-out-al-shabab-commander-in-somalia/3528110.html","Tue, 27 Sep 2016 23:02:25 -0400","USA",""," "
"ICC Sentences Islamist to 9 Years for Destroying Mali Shrines","In an unprecedented decision, the International Criminal Court Tuesday convicted a Muslim extremist of destroying centuries-old religious shrines in Mali.


It is the first time the Hague court has treated such destruction as a war crime, sentencing Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi to nine years in prison.


Al-Mahdi faced as much as 30 years in prison. But the court said it took into account his admission of guilt and regret, along with his plea to other Muslims not to do what he did.


Al-Mahdi was charged with overseeing the destruction of the centuries-old shrines with pickaxes and bulldozers in the ancient city of Timbuktu when Islamic extremists briefly seized control of northern Mali in 2012.


Timbuktu is a United Nations World Heritage site.


UNESCO chief Irina Bokova called the court's ruling against al-Mahdi a ""landmark in gaining recognition of the importance of heritage for humanity as a whole, and for the communities that have preserved it over the centuries.""


Timbuktu residents who watched the shrines being torn down also cheered. A tour guide told the French News Agency that ""justice has been served to our ancestors.""


State Department spokesman Mark Toner called such destruction a tool of terrorists to erase history and eradicate identities. He repeated Secretary of State John Kerry's assertion that such acts ""are a tragedy for all civilized people, and the civilized world must take a stand.""","http://www.voanews.com/a/icc-sentences-islamist-to-9-years-for-destroying-mali-shrines/3528084.html","Tue, 27 Sep 2016 22:16:34 -0400","Africa",""," "
"Shimon Peres' Life of Public Service Spanned the Life of Israel","Former Israeli President and Prime Minister Shimon Peres, whose life of public service spans the life of the Israeli nation itself, has died at age 93. 


Peres suffered a severe stroke two weeks ago and died Wednesday in the hospital in Tel HaShomer. 


He held nearly every major Israeli political post during his long career, including prime minister twice, the presidency, defense minister and foreign minister. 


He was the longest serving member of parliament in Israeli history, holding a seat in the Knesset for 48 years. 


Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Peres devoted his life to the sovereignty of the Israeli people.


""As a man of vision, his gaze was aimed to the future,"" he said.  ""As a man of security, he fortified Israel's strength in many ways, some of which even today is still unknown. As a man of peace, he worked until his final days toward reconciling with our neighbors for a better future for our children.""


U.S. President Barack Obama said no one did more than Peres to build the alliance between the United States and Israel and described him as a someone who forced people to expect more from themselves.


""He was guided by a vision of human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together.  He brought young people from around the world together because he knew they could carry us closer to our ideals of justice and equality,"" Obama said in a statement.




Former President Bill Clinton said that with the death of Peres, the Middle East ""has lost a fervent advocate for peace and reconciliation.""


Peres was born in present day Belarus in 1923 and moved to Israel when he was 11 years old, when the future Jewish state was under British mandate. 


He got his first taste of politics and diplomacy at age 23, when he was appointed to the Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. The congress was founded in 1897 to encourage Jewish emigration to Palestine. 


Peres became Israeli defense minister the first time in 1952, when he was just 29 years old. 


He is credited with working to develop Israel's defense and aerospace industries, and sources to buy modern weapons - which helped the newborn Jewish state survive. Peres also is said to have worked to develop Israel's nuclear program, which Israel has never confirmed having. 


The Israeli military was decimated by the 1973 Yom Kippur war and it was up to Peres, who again was serving as defense minister after several other posts, to rebuild Israel into a military powerhouse. 


While he was determined to make Israel as strong as ever, he was working behind the scenes for peace with Egypt. While rotating as prime minister with Yitzhak Shamir, Peres also worked to reduce tensions with Lebanon and Jordan. 


His major achievement was as foreign minister with the Oslo Accords -- a deal for Palestinian self-rule for which Peres, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize. 


Peres became prime minister a second time when Rabin was assassinated in 1995, but he lost reelection the following year. 


He was Israeli president from 2007 until 2014 -- a mainly ceremonial but important diplomatic post. 


Peres also founded the Peres Peace Center, which develops joint, economic, educational and cultural projects with the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan. 


He and continued to work for peace and cooperation until being felled by the stroke.","http://www.voanews.com/a/shimon-peres-life-of-public-service-spanned-the-life-of-israel/3528097.html","Tue, 27 Sep 2016 22:09:21 -0400","Middle East",""," "

But the appointment of Jeffrey DeLaurentis, which still must be confirmed by the Senate, is likely to set up a fierce fight with Republicans opposed to the normalization of relations with the communist nation.


DeLaurentis has been working at the new U.S. Embassy in Havana since it opened in July last year. Obama said there is ""no better qualified public servant.""


Cuban-American Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, both Republicans, tried to limit funding for the U.S. Embassy in Havana and said they would oppose any ambassador named by Obama.


DeLaurentis, a career diplomat, has served in Havana during the major transition of the one-time Cold War foes to a new relationship that includes re-opening embassies in Washington and Havana, and resuming travel and trade on a limited basis so far.


He would be the first U.S. envoy since Philip Bonsal, an appointee of President Dwight Eisenhower, left the post vacant in late 1960.","http://www.voanews.com/a/obama-appoints-jeffrey-delaurentis-as-cuba-ambassador/3528068.html","Tue, 27 Sep 2016 21:52:45 -0400","USA",""," "

"The Clinton-Trump debate broke TV records   but it wasn t the Super Bowl"," 



   84 million people watched last night.   Last night s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump drew more viewers than any debate in history. 
 But it still wasn t the biggest TV event of the year.  
 Nielsen says Clinton-Trump drew an average of 84 million viewers, beating the record Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan set in 1980, when they attracted 80.6 million viewers.   
 Four years ago, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney drew 67.2 million viewers in their highest-rated debate. 
 But even a record-setting debate isn t the Super Bowl: This year s matchup between the Broncos and the Panthers averaged 111.9 million viewers. The game has been consistently hovering around or above the 110 million-viewer mark for the past several years.  
 While some prognosticators thought Clinton-Trump might come close to that level, there were lots of reasons the debate wouldn t get to that number: For starters, it was up against  Monday Night Football,  which attracted eight million viewers. And like every other TV show, it s also up against an infinite array of digital options.  
 There s also the fact that many people don t like one or both of the candidates, which makes not watching them onstage an appealing choice.  
 Still, the audience Clinton and Trump did attract is an extraordinary one. 
 Reagan and Carter had a single debate, not three of them, and it was staged in an era where almost everyone watched the same thing on TV, because there was almost no choice   you watched CBS, ABC, NBC or nothing, more or less. No Twitter, no Facebook, no Snapchat   not even Fox, which didn t launch until the 1990s. 
 To focus that kind of attention in 2016 means something amazing is happening. ","http://www.recode.net/2016/9/27/13083434/clinton-trump-debate-record-tv-ratings","2016-09-27T19:37:46-04:00","NA",""," "
"Elon Musk will need one million Mars colonists to get the ticket price down to $200,000"," 



   Space travel isn t profitable   not yet anyway.   This afternoon,  in glorious detail , Elon Musk described his plan to send people to colonize Mars with his company SpaceX, the interplanetary transport startup he founded in 2002. 
 More than 100,000 people watched online as the entrepreneur spoke on stage at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico.  
 Musk described how Martian colonization would work. The ship he proposes to transport humans to the Red Planet is huge    12 meters in diameter and 122 meters tall. It s supposed to carry at least 100 people, have restaurants, a cinema, you name it. But there was one critical question he practically glossed over. How does SpaceX expect to pay for it all? 
 Although Musk joked about using Kickstarter to raise the tremendous amount of money he ll need to pay for the ambitious project,  ultimately,  he said,  this will be a huge public, private partnership.  
   
         
   
 NASA is already SpaceX s biggest customer, and the government agency is signed up to shuttle astronauts to the International Space Station as early as next year. 
 While Musk noted that NASA missions will bring in some profit, he also made very clear that he will need more money to bring his vision of Martian habitation to fruition.  
 Throughout the hour-long presentation, Musk continually underscored themes in efficiency and recycling parts, and he even vowed to dedicate his personal profits to fund Mars colonization. 
  I m only personally accumulating assets in order to fund this,  said Musk.  
 It was an unusually technical presentation lecture for a public visionary project, probably in an effort to show the world, and the U.S. government, just how serious he is. 
 Sending 12 astronauts to Mars will cost an estimated $10 billion per person, Musk said. But if one million people sign up, the cost would drop to a mere $200,000 per traveler, which he compared to the price of a house. 
 So scale is going to be super important here.  
 Musk needs to find a way not just to make the rockets reusable, which has been a key talking point for SpaceX as it practiced landing rockets on a robotic boat throughout the year, but also make it safe and popular. Yet safety wasn t a major theme today, although it did come up in audience questions. 
 Rather a more significant part of the presentation was dedicated to the reusability of the rockets, launching and refueling, all major factors in keeping the price down.  
 If Musk is is going to make his dreams of a colony on Mars come true, and convince the U.S. government it s worth investing billions of taxpayer dollars to do so, he ll have to be more persuasive on two counts: 
 1) Musk needs to think of a more motivating reason to send people to Mars other than the fact that Earth is home to seven billion people, while Mars is home to zero. 
 2) He ll have to convince the American public that we re not investing in giant rockets that will hurl brilliant scientists to their death in the cold throes of space. 
 Still, it s all very exciting to think about. ","http://www.recode.net/2016/9/27/13081488/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony-space-travel-funding-rocket-nasa","2016-09-27T19:26:20-04:00","NA",""," "

"Here's How 'Younger' Star Sutton Foster Likes to Chill Out","   
	  
	  Specs   
	 Age  41 
	 Claim to fame  TV Land's Younger (Season 3 premieres Sept. 28); Netflix's Gilmore Girls reboot; Tony Award winner. 
	 Base  New York 
	 Instagram   @suttonlenore  
 
	 What's the first information you consume in the morning?   
	I guess it's always my phone. I check my email, texts, and then Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It's horrible. I look at all of those things before I get out of bed. And then I switch over to The New York Times app and I read the morning briefing, so I can at least know what's going on in the world. 
	 
	 What's your go-to social platform?   
	I guess the one that I actually use the most is Instagram. I'm not much of a political activist or someone who uses Twitter as a platform. If anything, I'll use it to share videos of puppies and kittens [laughs]. I find that Instagram is more my speed. 
	 
	 Who do you follow on Instagram?   
	I just started following Black Jaguar-White Tiger. I love the Instagram pets&mdash;Marnie, Toast Meets World [laughs]. My little dream world that I've created in my head is full of puppy dogs and rainbows and people skipping around. And especially in a climate like we're in right now with so much shit going down, that's my escape. The number of kitten and puppy videos I torture my husband with is endless. I take great pride in what I post, too. That's what I love about Instagram&mdash;it's about putting something really beautiful out there for people to see. 
	 
	 I saw that you have an Instagram account for your own dog, @mabelthedorkie.   
	Oh yeah, I do. It's because somebody actually created a fake account for her on Twitter or something, and I was like, &quot;You can't do that! It's my dog!&quot; So I made one. She's so frickin' cute. I want her to be a famous dog in her own right because she's so adorable! So I really need to work on her social media and her PR. She definitely needs a publicist and a book deal. 
	 
	 What TV shows do you watch?   
	My husband and I watched  Stranger Things  on Netflix because everyone was talking about it. We're big fans of Game of Thrones. Now we're on a search for a new program, so I think we might try Happy Valley or Peaky Blinders. And I've also been re-watching  Gilmore Girls  on my own. It makes me so happy. It's like hanging out with an old friend. 
	 
	 Do you listen to any podcasts?   
	I love  Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me,  and Mystery Show is one of my favorites. It's this really quirky little podcast, and the girl who hosts it has this great sense of humor and really great demeanor. She does these mini mysteries&mdash;she's like Nancy Drew&mdash;and it's her commentary that makes it so entertaining. It's not big mysteries or anything like that&mdash;one of them might be about someone who found a belt buckle with someone's initials on it and she tries to find the story behind it. 
	 
	 What's on your reading list?   
	I've got a few books on my nightstand. One is called Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead. I'm kind of in a self-help book phase. I've been reading about opening up, letting go, all that stuff. [Laughs] It's horrible and wonderful at the same time!

	AOL CEO  Tim Armstrong  took to the Times Center stage on Monday for a conversation with NBC's Stephanie Ruhle to discuss the current and future state of media through the lens of brand building&mdash;something the exec has made a name for himself doing during his seven-year tenure at the storied internet company. 
 
	Part of the 60-minute chat was about content-business acquisition, which wouldn't have been complete without addressing future buys. Ruhle suggested Twitter, the content behemoth with a monetization problem, would be a good project for Armstrong's team if parent Verizon could make the purchase. He didn't address the question, but he did defend the microblogging platform, saying its marketing is a lot better than it gets credit for, and it's actually the marketers that are behind. 
 
	&quot;If you're a marketer, should you be upset that Twitter isn't up to snuff or should you be upset at yourself that you're not talking to consumers in real time?&quot; he posited to the packed auditorium of brand execs and marketers. &quot;I don't know that much about Twitter's ad program, but I do know that marketing real time might be a more effective use of getting consumer engagement.&quot; 
 
	The majority of the discussion was spent reviewing the entrepreneurial spirit of the brands in AOL's portfolio, including ones acquired during Armstrong's tenure like the Huffington Post, Makers and Build. Though, the conversation often turned toward the meatier issues facing the media world. 
 
	Unlike many of his media contemporaries, Armstrong isn't wringing his hands over the content creation explosion taking hold in the industry. Describing AOL as a &quot;content company,&quot; Armstrong doesn't see Facebook and Google as posing a threat to brands like TechCrunch and HuffPo. 
 
	&quot;People want to eat news everyday. People want a curated, trusted voice, and I think that's not going away,&quot; he said. &quot;Do as much social media as you want, but at the end of the day, people want a trusted voice.&quot; 
 
	AOL's current iteration operates under the idea that content is king, and Armstrong clearly believes his platform is heir apparent. He even sees it as the solution for digital advertising, adding that the ad-tech world was responsible for the current dismal state of digital advertising. 
 
	&quot;I think the industry got incredibly lazy&mdash;I think AOL got incredibly lazy&mdash;by not worrying about what they put in front of consumers, but worrying about the tech platforms behind those,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it led to ad blocking, and AOL has to innovate ad formats. Consumers are really good at spending their time&mdash;they're better at spending their time than their money&mdash;and we should not be putting things in front of them that aren't great pieces of content.&quot; 
 
	Another of Armstrong's ad-tech prognostications is that, contrary to many media forecasts, online advertising will become more expensive in the future, owing this theory to the difficulties in unhooking the convenience provided by digital platforms&mdash;think recurring monthly Amazon order where a year's supply of brand products is decided with one click.

"Lowe's Launches Media Agency Review After More Than 10 Years With OMD","   
	Home improvement retail chain Lowe's has issued an RFI ahead of its first media agency review since 2005. 
 
	The review comes roughly 10 months after the Mooresville, N.C., chain promoted former vp of advertising Marci Grebstein to the role of chief marketing officer reporting to chief customer officer&nbsp;Michael A. Jones. 
 
	&quot;As part of the normal course of business, we regularly review the agencies and vendors that support our company to evaluate our objectives against performance and ensure we remain strategically aligned,&quot; a company spokesperson told Adweek. &quot;As the consumer and media landscape continues to rapidly evolve, we are exploring the most compelling and efficient ways to reach consumers to help ensure we remain well positioned.&quot; 
 
	Grebstein, who joined the company in 2015 after holding vp of marketing positions at Food Lion and Staples,  recently spoke  of the chain's efforts to reach millennials via the Lowe's Innovation Lab and campaigns powered by Snapchat and other social media platforms. 
 
	Global marketing consultancy R3 is managing the review, which is in its initial stages. 
 
	Lowe's Companies Inc. is currently the U.S.'s second-largest home improvement retailer and its eighth-largest retail company by annual sales. According to the latest numbers from Kantar Media, Lowe's spent approximately $320 million on paid media in 2015 and $162 million in the first half of 2016. 
 
	The chain's last such review  was in late 2005, &nbsp;when Lowe's consolidated its media and creative accounts with OMD and BBDO, respectively, after several years with IPG's McCann and Universal McCann. The current review does not involve the creative portion of the business. 
 
	The news follows a streak of large-scale wins for Omnicom's media networks, chief among them the  recent McDonald's consolidation, &nbsp;the $2 billion December 2015 P&amp;G win that facilitated  the launch  of new media network Hearts &amp; Science, and  AT&amp;T's decision  to move its media business away from WPP's MEC following the acquisition of DirecTV. One client, yogurt brand Chobani,  chose independent shop Horizon Media  as its new media agency of record in August after five years with the Omnicom network. 
 
	A spokesperson for OMD, which was Adweek's Global Media Agency of the Year for both  2014  and  2015,  deferred to the client for comment and declined to confirm whether it would be defending the Lowe's account. One source with direct knowledge of the matter suggested that another Omnicom entity would be participating in the review.

"Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr Just Launched Their Own Voter Registration Day Campaigns","   
	Several social networks are taking on their democratic duty to get people to vote in November. 
 
	Today&mdash;on National Voter Registration Day&mdash;Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter have debuted in-house initiatives to get potential voters registered ahead of national, state and local elections happening in just a few weeks. (Today, Twitter also began running its own promoted  #iRegistered  hashtag as a way to get users to take a few minutes to register.) 
 
	From today through Sept. 30, Instagram users will see a sponsored post inside the app that if clicked on will direct them to the official  U.S. voter registration website . The move is in large part directed at younger voters, which the company says make up around two-thirds of users who currently follow presidential candidate accounts. 
 
	&quot;We love seeing the election conversation happening on Instagram,&quot; said John Tass-Parker, Instagram's politics and government outreach manager. &quot;We also look forward to the community using their voice on the biggest platform&mdash;Election Day&mdash;and it starts with registering to vote.&quot; 
 
	Along with voter registration ads, Instagram also plans to partner with the multiple TV networks that target younger voters. The app is partnering with CBS News for live debate coverage through Instagram Stories, focused on millennials. With CNN, Instagram is launching a #MYVote campaign and projection tour to better understand what motivates young voters. 
 
	For its initiative, Tumblr users will see a new switch on their dashboard, which will direct those who click on it to register to vote through the national voter registration website. The feature ends at 11 p.m. today. According to a staff  blog post  on Tumblr's website, only 42 percent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in the last election. 
 
	&quot;What's at stake? Oh, just gun violence, racial justice, the Supreme Court, education, a living wage, health care, clean water, immigration, the war on drugs, legal weed, access to abortion, national security, the gender gap, trans rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and the right to love who you love.&quot; 
 
	Instagram and Tumblr aren't the only two putting their millennial muscle behind promoting voter registration. Last week, both  Google  and  Snapchat  launched their own campaigns featuring a string of celebrities. 
 
	According to TurboVote, a nonprofit campaign aimed at increasing voter turnout, it only takes one minute to register. (Today, YouTube began  running short 1:34 videos  to show how quick the process can be.)

"Leading Hotel Marketers Claim They Aren't Worried About Airbnb","   
	If there's one thing rarer than getting the marketing chiefs of the world's big three hotel chains on the same stage, it's having each of them deny that Airbnb concerns them. But that was the upshot earlier today at Advertising Week, as Hyatt's svp of global brands Sandra Micek, Hilton's CMO Geraldine Calpin and Marriott's global marketing officer  Karin Timpone  took turns explaining why Airbnb fails to keep them awake at night. 
 
	&quot;We don't spend a lot of time worrying about them, but instead focus on making the guest experience better,&quot; Calpin said. 
 
	&quot;There's not much crossover,&quot; added Micek, explaining that &quot;Hyatt provides relevance so guests can choose what's right for them.&quot; 
 
	&quot;There's a lot we can learn from the sharing economy,&quot; Timpone said, though she added that communal spaces&mdash;one of the many features that Airbnb rentals have proven can be popular with guests, especially younger ones&mdash;are &quot;a good thing to keep an eye on.&quot; (Marriott's Residence Inn brand has, she added, had some success in experimenting with communal areas.) 
 
	But left unsaid in the session was the fact that, whether these executives are fretting or not, Airbnb continues to be the 800-pound gorilla of hospitality that cannot be ignored. Last year, the Hotel Association of New York City commissioned HVS to report on the  impact that Airbnb was having  on the lodging sector of just New York, and the results were enough to send a hotel executive straight to the lobby bar. 
 
	According to the report, Airbnb-induced losses to New York's hotels from September 2014 to August 2015 were north of $451 million. There was plenty of bad news for other industries, too. Factoring in tax losses to the construction industry, and the money that Airbnb customers won't spend on food and beverage, AVS estimated Airbnb's total economic impact at $2.1 billion for the period. 
 
	&quot;Airbnb has quickly become a threat to hotels as travelers choose to book with independent hosts&hellip; rather than traditional hotels,&quot; Revenueyourhotel.com founder  Ahmed Mahmoud &nbsp;said earlier this year, explaining that hotels in regions where Airbnb is established have lowered prices in response, which hurts both them and their competitors. 
 
	Despite the evident threat, however, Micek, Calpin and Timpone's optimism isn't necessarily misplaced. The U.S. hotel industry continues to expand, according to the  2015 trends report  released by the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association. The American hotel industry grew from 52,000 to 53,432 properties last year, and added nearly 179,000 rooms. 
 
	Founded in San Francisco in 2008, Airbnb now does business in over 34,000 cities and claims to have booked over 60 million total guests.

"MRF zips past Rs 50,000, becomes India's most expensive stock","NEW DELHI: MRF Ltd, the most expensive stock on BSE in stock price terms, breached the Rs 50,000 mark on Wednesday for the first time, thanks to a massive 650 per cent surge in the past five years amid rising demand from OEM and replacement markets.  The scrip on Wednesday soared 7.29 per cent to hit a high of Rs 50,000 before retreating a bit. The scrip eventually closed the day at Rs 49,989, up 7.27 per cent. The stock has traded in a wide range of Rs 30,000-50,000 in last one year. The market-cap of the tyre company stood at Rs 21,201 crore at Wednesday's closing.  On an unadjusted basis, state-run MMTC had hit a closing high above Rs 55,000 level in November 2007.  On adjusted basis, Bosch has hit Rs 27,989.25 level in March 2015, data compiled by Capitaline showed. Dalal Street Investments, Eicher Motors, Zandu Realty and Ravalgaon Sugar are some of the BSE-listed companies which have risen above Rs 20,000 apiece on closing basis in their trading history.  Industry experts expect tyre makers to see a moderation in revenue growth on recovery in rubber prices, even though volumes growth is expected to continue going ahead.   Revenue growth of major tyre manufacturers is likely to be in the range of 3-6 per cent in FY17, with higher volume growth negating the year-on-year decline in pricing. Companies could see a moderation in Ebitda margins, due to the recent increase in input costs as well as pricing pressures,  India Ratings said in a note.  The rating agency said the trend of price increases is unlikely to be sustained and prices will stabilise at current level due to the prevailing demand-supply dynamics of rubber.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tyres-with-muscle-mrf-zips-past-rs-50000-emerges-indias-most-expensive-stock/articleshow/54563159.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 10:07:47 GMT","NA",""," "
"Waitlisted? Don't worry, railways plans to get you a confirmed train ride soon","BENGALURU: Railway authorities have plans to introduce shadow trains in high-demand sectors such as Bengaluru-Chennai, Bengaluru-Ernakulam, Bengaluru-Howrah and Bengaluru-Belgaum.  The idea, however, is still in discussion stage and will take wings only after the Railways is able to overcome the bottlenecks.  Shadow trains are those that follow the main trains after a gap of 15 to 30 minutes. For example, Kanyakumari Express or Shatabdi Express are always full, so railways can introduce trains that closely follow these trains. By doing this, the Railways -besides dealing with rising demand -can also earn some revenue.  ""We will identify the sectors that are regularly full. But we can implement this idea only after the availability of the path and the coaches improve,"" said a railway official. ""We will need double lines, less congestion and better infrastructure,"" he added.    The Railways does not want to lose passengers, especially those booked on the AC coaches. Though small in number, they make up a substantial portion of passenger revenues, and the Railways has been exploring ways to retain this revenue.  It is precisely for this reason that the Railways introduced the alternative train accommodation scheme under the name Vikalp. It provides for alternative accommodation for passengers on tickets booked through the IRCTC site. If a traveller has booked a ticket on the Rajdhani and is waitlisted, the Railways will try to accommodate the passenger on another train running to the same destination on the same day .  First introduced on Delhi-Lucknow and Delhi-Jammu, the facility is now available on Bengaluru-Delhi route too. Vikalp is currently run as a pilot project, and authorities said they will soon be able to extend it to other high demand sectors from Bengaluru. Vikalp, the official explained, was introduced to provide confirmed accommodation to waitlisted passengers by using up every available seat as it is illegal for them to board reserved coaches. Under the scheme, the authorities are augmenting the sector capacity either by attaching additional coaches to clear waitlisted passengers or by running extra trains.  ""The facility is available only on e-ticketing option. This is not yet open on all the sectors, which we will do as we go along. This requires a lot of tweaking of the software in the reservation system,"" the official said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/waitlisted-like-irctcs-vikalp-you-can-hope-to-board-shadow-outbound-trains/articleshow/54558661.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 08:26:45 GMT","NA",""," "
"Pakistan knocks on World Bank's door to stop India from exploiting water treaty","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan today approached the World Bank amid reports that India could revoke the 56-year- old Indus Water Treaty, with senior Pakistani officials taking up the matter with the international lender which had mediated the water-sharing deal.  A delegation of the Government of Pakistan led by the Attorney General for Pakistan, Ashtar Ausaf Ali, met with senior officials of the World Bank at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington DC, to discuss matters relating to Pakistan's recent Request for Arbitration given to India pursuant to Article IX of the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960, Geo News reported.  The report also said Pakistan approached the International Court of Justice, but did not provide any details.  On 19 August, Pakistan had formally requested India for settlement of outstanding disputes pertaining to India's construction of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants on rivers Neelum and Chenab respectively, by referring the matters to the Court of Arbitration as provided in Article IX of the Treaty.  Under the treaty, the World Bank has an important role in establishment of the Court of Arbitration by facilitating the process of appointment of three judges, called Umpires, to the Court, while each country appoints two arbitrators.  The Pakistani officials met with senior officials of the World Bank to insist on early appointment of the judges and empanelment the court, it said.  The Pakistani delegation consisted of Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf Ali; Secretary, Ministry of Water & Power, Muhammad Younus Dagha; Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters, Mirza Asif Baig and others, it said.  Pakistan's Ambassador to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani and World Bank's Executive Director for Pakistan Nasir Khosa were also present.  In the meeting with the Pakistani delegation, the World Bank committed itself to timely fulfilling its obligations under the treaty while remaining neutral, the report said.  Under the treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan President Ayub Khan in September 1960, waters of six rivers - Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - were to be shared between the two countries.  The treaty provides specific design criteria for any hydro-electric power plants to be built by India. Pakistan has held the position the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants violate the design parameters of the treaty.  Earlier, Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs and Security, Sartaj Aziz said an attempt by India to block Pakistan's water could be seen as ""an act of war.""  Yesterday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with officials to review provisions of the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.  In that meeting it was decided that India will ""exploit to the maximum"" the water of Pakistan-controlled rivers, including Jhelum, as per the water-sharing pact.

Sources in Nepal, the current Chair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, confirmed having received messages from the four countries conveying their inability to attend the summit due in Islamabad on November 9-10.  The sources said that the Himalayan nation is yet to take a decision on calling off the summit, which is over a month away.  With the Saarc process based on consensus, even if one member does not attend the summit is automatically postponed or cancelled.  However, a final decision rests on the current Saarc Secretary General Arjun Bahadur Thapa, who is currently in New York and will return in two days.  With half of the eight-nation regional bloc deciding to skip the event, there is every possibility of the event being postponed, in a big diplomatic snub to Pakistan.  Sri Lanka has already said that the Saarc Summit would not be possible without India's participation.  India on Tuesday announced that it was pulling out of the Islamabad summit in the wake of the September 18 cross-border terror attack on an Indian Army base in Uri town of Jammu and Kashmir, which New Delhi has blamed on terrorists based in Pakistan.  The Uri attack came amid the dragging unrest and violence in Kashmir Valley that has left around 90 people dead since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani on July 8.  In a statement on Tuesday, India said increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region and growing interference in the internal affairs of Saarc member-states ""by one country"" have created an environment that was not conducive to the successful holding of the 19th Saarc summit.  Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup said that India has conveyed to Nepal its decision not to attend the summit, for which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to go.  ""India remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in an atmosphere free of terror.  ""In the prevailing circumstances, the Government of India is unable to participate in the proposed summit in Islamabad,"" he said in the statement.  Pakistan has termed the boycott decision as ""unfortunate"".  In its message to Nepal on Tuesday, Afghanistan said that because of ""increased level of violence and fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on Afghanistan, President of Afghanistan Mohammad Ashraf Ghani with his responsibilities as the Commander in Chief will be fully engaged, and will not be able to attend the summit"".  In a similar message to Nepal, Bangladesh said: ""The growing interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh by one country has created an environment which is not conducive to the successful hosting of the 19th Saarc Summit in Islamabad in November 2016.""  ""Bangladesh, as the initiator of the Saarc process, remains steadfast in its commitment to regional cooperation, connectivity and contacts but believes that these can only go forward in a more congenial atmosphere,"" the message said.  ""In view of the above, Bangladesh is unable to participate in the proposed summit in Islamabad.""  Bhutan, in its message, cited ""the recent escalation of terrorism in the region"" as the reason for its non-participation.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/islamabad-saarc-summit-likely-to-be-called-off/articleshow/54563392.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 10:01:01 GMT","NA",""," "
"BPTP in talks to sell Gurgaon land to Godrej Properties","BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Real estate developer BPTP is in the process of selling its land parcel in Gurgaon to Godrej Properties. The 20-acre land along the Dwarka Expressway is valued at around Rs 350 crore, said two persons familiar with the development. ""Both the companies are in the final stages of the deal,"" said one of the persons with direct knowledge of the transaction.  BPTP is likely to utilise a part of the money received from the land sale to repay JP Morgan Chase as settlement in a dispute over the bank exiting from its investment in the company. ""Some part of the money will be paid to Citi too,"" said another person who did not want to be named. This is also one of the few transactions where Godrej Properties is buying land parcel on outright basis for project development.  The real estate development arm of Godrej Group usually prefers to enter into joint development agreements to undertake projects than buying plots on outright basis.  An email query to BPTP remained unanswered until going to press. Godrej Properties responded to query saying, ""As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on market speculation.""  Godrej Properties is currently developing residential, commercial and township projects spread across around 128 million square feet in 12 cities in India.  Earlier this year, Godrej Properties forayed into the Noida market with a development management agreement to build a housing project on a 36-acre plot.  While this is Godrej Properties' first project in Noida, it is its sixth in the National Capital Region (NCR).  Last year, BPTP agreed to buy out CPI's shareholding for Rs 333 crore and JP Morgan's shareholding for Rs 360 crore payable over a period of time. In 2006, BPTP raised Rs 322 crore from CPI India, a Citigroup fund, now managed by Apollo Management, by selling 5.67% equity stake in the company.  In 2008-09, the realtor further raised Rs 241 crore in two rounds of funding from a subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase group of companies by selling 6.21% stake.  BPTP is also in the process of selling a 25-acre land parcel in Hyderabad for Rs 250 crore to retire old debts. The company plans to sell some of the noncore assets to raise funds for meeting business requirements, said one of the persons mentioned above.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/bptp-in-talks-to-sell-gurgaon-land-to-godrej-properties/articleshow/54399987.cms","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:24:16 GMT","NA",""," "
"Teva Pharmaceutical inks largest realty deal for HQ at Goregaon","MUMBAI: The world's largest generic pharmaceutical company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, has inked a deal for 1.25 lakh sq ft office space for lease in Oberoi Realty's commercial complex Commerz II in Goregaon suburb of Mumbai in the largest transaction for headquarters by any company, said three persons familiar with the development.  ""The transaction was concluded recently and the company will start operating from the new premise in the next twothree months. The design and fit-out work will commence soon,"" said one of the persons mentioned above.  The Israeli multinational pharmaceutical company will be shifting its India headquarters and consolidating six offices in Mumbai in this newly leased space, spread over four floors. The New York Stock Exchange-listed firm's current India headquarter operations are split into two-three office buildings in the Powai suburb of Mumbai.    The drug-maker will be paying Rs 140-145 per sq ft per month for the space. Teva has leased the front-office space for five years and rentals will be escalated after three years.  Teva will be paying close to Rs 22 crore as rentals every year for the next three years. Rent will be reset for the next two years after that.  The transaction assumes significance as the space is being picked up for the company's headquarters and that too in Goregaon, not in any of the metro's business districts.  ""We are delighted that Teva Pharmaceuticals has chosen Commerz II, our commercial building and part of Oberoi Garden City, for their India headquarters. Convenient location off the Western Express Highway and the proposed metro for easy connectivity between north-south corridor of Mumbai has aided the response to Commerz II,"" said Vikas Oberoi, CMD, Oberoi Realty, confirming the transaction.  Email queries to Teva remained unanswered until the time of going to press. Transaction advisor JLL India declined to offer a comment for the story.  The transaction shows that the commercial property market in the country's commercial capital continues to be robust. Low vacancy levels across office complexes and lack of new commercial space being ready to move are contributing to the rents firming up. Vacancy levels in other commercial complexes in the vicinity along Western Express Highway including Nirlon Knowledge Park and Nesco are currently close to zero.  Since 2015, office space absorption across major Indian property markets has been growing on the back of a combination of lower rents and a positive economic outlook, which makes it certain that the recovery, this time, is more sustainable and long-term in comparison with 2011.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/teva-pharmaceutical-inks-largest-realty-deal-for-hq-at-goregaon/articleshow/54399935.cms","Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:18:27 GMT","NA",""," "

"" The deal could be struck at a valuation of around Rs 300 crores.There are three other suitors in the race, including I-Squared Capital.

"Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital drags Neelkanth township, promoter to NCLT","Private equity fund Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital (UIVC), floated by Anand Jain's Jai Corp with Reliance Industries (RIL) as an anchor investor, has filed a petition in The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Neelkanth Township & Construction and its promoter Bhavik Bhimjyani.  The petition has accused the Mumbai-based builder of misappropriation of funds, creation of fraudulent accounts, mismanagement of the company and defaulting on loans and commitments in its Alibaug residential township project. However, Bhimjyani denies these allegations. He said that the fund didn't bring in Rs 200-crore capital that was committed, leading to the project's delay.   Right from the date of investment in Neelkanth in 2007, UIVC has had its nominees on the Neelkanth board and has been aware of the activities, decisions and transactions in Neelkanth,  Bhavik Bhimjyani said in an email response. An email sent to UIVC remained unanswered until the time of going to press.  The fund also counts Bhimjyani's relatives Tulsi Bhimjyani and Anshul Bhimjyani as respondents.But Tulsi Bhimjyani responded that he and his family are neither directors nor shareholders.  The petition has alleged that Bhimjyani held illegal meetings without notifying the fund and tried to take control of the board by in creasing the number of nomineedirectors to 10 from two.  In 2007, UIVC had invested Rs 50 lakh as equity for a 40% stake in Neelkanth Township & Construction, while the promoters invested Rs 75 lakh for the remaining 60%. The fund also invested Rs 51 crore through debentures. Neelkanth Township was looking to acquire about 150 acres of land in Alibaug, near Mumbai, to develop a project to build bungalows.  In 2007-2008, UIVC had invested in two projects -Alibaug and Pune --through debentures and equity. The petition says that the builder's loan and interest repayment defaults would cumulatively amount to Rs 200 crore since 2010-11.  UIVC has also filed an application in the Bombay HC to appoint an arbitrator for its ongoing disputes.  The petition also points out that UIVC found out in August 2015 that Neelkanth Township, at the instance of the promoters, had paid Rs 5.27 crore as advance to another promoter-group company --Lighthouse Developers. The advance was paid for purported acquisition of land without indication of any location, price or area. Further, it mentions that this sum was used by Lighthouse Developers to repay the promoters' loan and not for buying land.  However, according to Bhimjyani, there is no illegal or unfair conduct either at the board or general body meetings of Neelkanth under the current management. His emailed response says, ""There has been no misappropriation of funds or creation of any fraudulent accounts or related party transactions. Allegations of non-supply of accounts   belatedly made   are false.""  According to Bhimjyani, the nominees of UIVC had not attended any board or general body meeting of Neelkanth between 2011 and 2015.From 2007, the fund hasn't made any allegations of non-receipt of notice, either of the board or of the general body meeting of Neelkanth and were made for the first time in 2015, close to the fund's expiry date.  Both parties had also held meetings between 2011 and 2012 for settlement of the issue through mediation of a large business house. However, the settlement could not be reached as the promoters of Neelkanth reneged from the terms agreed during these meetings.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/urban-infrastructure-venture-capital-dragsneelkanthtownship-promoter-tonclt/articleshow/54560125.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 06:50:52 GMT","NA",""," "
"Want to know which all stocks have turned expensive? Try this formula","NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market saw a meteoric rise in the last 6-7 month, thanks to the loose money policies adopted by several central banks the world over, which eased liquidity conditions and fuelled a smart rally in individual stocks which are now looking slightly expensive.  Equity benchmark Sensex has rallied over 26 per cent from its 52-week low of 22,494 and a little over 7 per cent in last three months. It has risen about 8 per cent so far in 2016 compared with a 52 per cent rally seen in the shares of PVR, 33 per cent in Tata Motors and about 11 per cent in SBI in the same period.  Some of the stocks are looking expensive and have already seen a fair bit of correction, but there could be more room for further downside as the June quarter earnings failed to cheer investors, experts said.   The current round of consolidation in the market has been due to global factors and any cue on stabilisation will bring cheer to the market. At the same time, we also find stocks where valuations have moved above historical averages, but subdued June quarter results have not left any room for further pickup in valuations,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit BNP Paribas, told ETMarkets.com.   We believe stocks like PVR, Tata Motors, ONGC, Axis Bank, Jubilant FoodWorks and NTPC have expanded beyond the recent improvement in financials, i.e. growth in price has been more than requisite,  he said.    Which are the expensive stocks?  Stocks that have either seen a strong runup in prices or are trading ahead of their fundamentals owing to any positive news flow could be trading in the high-valuation zone.  In simple terms, irrespective of quality or credentials, any stock can be considered expensive if valuation has moved substantially above historical averages and the future outlook does not offer any material upside.   For example, we did see stocks in pockets such as PSU banks and levered infrastructure players run up sharply in the current market rally. But, these segments continue to be plagued by NPAs and stretched balance sheets respectively,  Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICI Securities, told ETMarkets.com.   Therefore, the above-mentioned stocks can see huge swings as they do not merit a place in your portfolio given their hazy fundamental outlook,  he said.  How to identify expensive stocks?  Generally, investors sell off a stock, terming it as expensive, when the price goes up substantially. However, that may not be true, experts said.  If underlying earnings rise significantly, an astronomical rise in a stock is all but natural. Investors should sell a stock only when it becomes expensive and not because of daily price movement or correction in the market.  Investors can identify an expensive stock two ways. First, they should do a comparison for last 10 years on various valuation parameters such as PE and PB ratios.   For example, if the highest and lowest PE levels of a stock in last 10 years have been 30 and 15, those should be considered the benchmarks for higher and lower valuation multiples,  Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities, told ETMarkets.com.   If the stock is currently trading at the higher end of the multiple, then the stock is expensive,  he said.  The second way is to compare the valuation parameters with that of respective industry multiples.  If the stock is quoting at a multiple above industry average, then there is an opportunity to encash the premium valuation, provided the same kind of premium valuation was not available in the past,  Modi said.  ""However, the above factors are based purely on quantitative numbers. Many a time, qualitative aspects should also be looked at before taking the call to sell a stock,  he said.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/want-to-know-which-all-stocks-have-turned-expensive-try-this-formula/articleshow/54558461.cms","Wed, 28 Sep 2016 05:59:04 GMT","NA",""," "

"Sashastra Seema Bal increases vigil along Indo-Nepal border ahead of PM Modi's visit","MAHARAJGANJ: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheduled visit to Gorakhpur on July 22, Uttar Pradesh Police and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) have stepped up vigil along the Indo-Nepal border that falls under the Gorakhpur-Basti division.  During the visit, Modi is expected to announce the restarting of a fertiliser factory and to lay the foundation stone of the proposed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) beside addressing a rally.  To prevent movement of terrorists in the area, security agencies have been asked to ascertain identities of people before allowing them to cross over the border, IG (Gorakhpur Zone) Mohit Agarwal said.  Orders have also been issued to other security agencies such as Indo-Nepal Border Police and Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) to be on the alert at the border.  ""All the border outposts (BOPs) have been kept on high alert. Patrolling in sensitive border areas has been increased to check anti-nationals element,"" a senior SSB official said.  ""We received instruction that some insurgent might be crossing over and so we have been asked to maintain a strict vigil,"" SSB Deputy Commandant Manish Kumar said.  Police in the districts of Mahrajganj, Siddharthanagar, Shrawasti and Bahraich, sharing border with Nepal, have been put on high alert, Agarwal said.

"My first year at work - 'I respected my time, indulged in cycling & photography'","Yogesh Agarwal Cofounder at CareOnGo as told to Prachi Verma Dadhwal  The brief I was given and what I did in the first 100 days at work In my first job, which was at Deloitte, I was tasked with finding process gaps in the inventory management. Though the job in itself was daunting, I couldn't stop at a single task. While understanding the process inefficiencies, I got pulled along into the entire process right from manufacturing to warehousing to stocking-giving me the entire picture to find the exact gaps. I worked closely with various health clients in the US and Europe, and while analysing the processes, I found a lot of inefficiency which could be improved.  The worst mistake I made With the initial fire of working in such a big project, I started doing extensive research by myself. After a few days of getting exhausted by it, I realised that this should have been first discussed with the team to get a picture of the challenges they faced.  The best leadership lessons I learnt As andrew carnegie said, ""No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself, or get all the credit for doing it."" I learnt pretty early that both teamwork and leadership are instrumental for a small company's success and it is the combined efforts of individual minds that can result in creating something unprecedented. On starting my venture with co-founders, I have tried to incorporate the same values in welcoming out-of-the-box ideas from other employees at work and collectively achieving the targets.  How I had fun at work Communication is a huge stress buster for me, and during late hours spent at office I started engaging in discussions-be it complex business problems or personal hurdles-with my colleague. This was to understand different mindsets.  How I managed my work-life balance I respected my ""me"" time and indulged in activities I am zealous about--cycling and photography.  Apart from meeting goals at work, I made sure I set personal goals the same way, which is why I took up adventure sports like skiing and mountain biking. I believe in striking a balance between work and play, alongside pushing myself to take up challenging activities for that adrenaline rush.  My biggest innovation My tryst was in identifying the gaps in the operational processes to maintain stock. After brainstorming with the team, I devised an algorithm which could increase the efficiency in inventory management by 23% and reduce manpower by 15%.","http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/my-first-year-at-work-i-respected-my-time-indulged-in-cycling-photography/articleshow/54477054.cms","Fri, 23 Sep 2016 06:10:06 GMT","NA",""," "
